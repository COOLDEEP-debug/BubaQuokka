13/03/25, 12:11 am - Quokka: i guess i m speculating the mentality that you are aware of about gujrat, as we both shared amazing memories of rajkot na
13/03/25, 12:13 am - Quokka: interesting in the sense of freedom i guess 
waves nd sunset i am aware with a chilled beer i m not.
13/03/25, 12:14 am - ~ Buba: Sorry I am too dumb to make out where are you from from this answer of yours...

13/03/25, 12:28 am - ~ Buba: TBH I can understand where it's coming from....Before Krishna, I was in super fun schools and had everything that has everything opposite to what we had in our school...so after coming to Krishna, I didn't liked that much and wanted to complete my tenure as soon as possible & in process of doing so had started resisting people, which was opposite to my nature...which backfired very badly in everysense...so yeah what you saw in Krishna was just me pissed off 24x7 so that made my image over there ig

15/03/25, 11:41 pm - ~ Buba: Mere liye bhi this is the first time only, but my logic says that what matters is amount of time we spend on each other & if u see about amount of just interaction we had in last few days is more than many people have in a month... shear amount of time u & me have given to each other in this short time is literally quite high
15/03/25, 11:41 pm - ~ Buba: U might be a bit doubtful about it, 
but I am quite clear about this...
15/03/25, 11:42 pm - ~ Buba: I have also started writing stuff after quite a long time, so yeah I am observing some positive changes in my life...which is clear notation of your love
15/03/25, 11:43 pm - ~ Buba: But if you are doubtful that means somewhere I haven't given u enough reasons to feel confident in us

16/03/25, 1:40 am - Quokka: i have that too based on conversations we had nd time we gave
16/03/25, 1:41 am - Quokka: its kind of a fear of loosing everything again holds me back. 
how can i explain i dont know but it is there within me 
i don't know how to deal with it
16/03/25, 1:49 am - ~ Buba: Yup,  it's really good that u r able to discuss this feeling of yours. I don't wanna overpower any of my feelings onto u, but still let me listen down my points as the same things I was thinking yesterday afternoon that I am giving these much energy and what if this is just some momentarily thins,so the breakdown of my points in a summary is as follows:
As of now, I know I haven't connected like this with anyone this quickly. It can't be only physical attraction from mine cause although I saw your pic but still I don't know in my head how u look (although it just doesn't matter, but stating cause let's discuss every parameter). It can't be a short term attraction cause I know myself I wouldnt have given these much time & if this would have been a casual attraction I would not have felt to talk to you after some amount of our conversation (I know how I feel when I have casual)...

If u wanna discuss anything more about it...we can definitely do. Don't get influenced from my text, use this as a base parameter & think about it & let me know how u feel <This message was edited>

16/03/25, 1:58 am - Quokka: ypu literally point down everything i wanted to discuss.
i m glad that you did mention everything i was thinking about.
just a one thing is going on after all of this
i guess you sense how emotional i m nd i can be or i will be i know now my boundaries but i don't think so ill be able to do it everytime 
nd i know you like you are sensible man but you are rational in every sense. 
what do you think about this difference?
16/03/25, 1:58 am - ~ Buba: Just to keep atmosphere light😅
16/03/25, 1:59 am - Quokka: 🥺🥺🥺🥺❤️❤️❤️
16/03/25, 2:00 am - Quokka: 😂😂😂😂😂
16/03/25, 2:01 am - Quokka: surbhi naam he uska bhi
16/03/25, 2:09 am - ~ Buba: So in order to perfectly understand your question - u know u r emotional and your boundaries about it. But I failed to understand what thing  you don't think u will be able to do it every time?

& About being rational & emotional....I would say my answer can or can't be the way u r thinking. I don't think u r only emotional person.what u do is show your emotional side to the person u love and rational side to the rest of the world. So you are a mixture of both but you show your different characteristics based on your feelings. But cause deep down u r having both rational as well as emotional mindset, all of your decisions are not either only rational nor only emotional based. Those decisions of yours are a combination of both of them, that's why u r able to question the feeling u r experiencing, which is one of the reasons I feel getting attracted to u ( u r bit different, sexy wala different).

This is my take based on my level of understanding, u can think about yours and let me know <This message was edited>
16/03/25, 2:12 am - ~ Buba: & yes I am not rational about everything.....if this would have been a totally rational Kuldeep, I wouldn't have been giving this time of mine to this beautiful thing of ours....I think i take a balanced approach from the rational & emotional side.
16/03/25, 2:14 am - Quokka: i meant to say that i know my boundaries but i also know that if i m dealing with a person i m with 
i can not hold some stable steady foot i mean i fall too much i sometimes forget to be someone who can think rationally nd i guess here i fuck up.
16/03/25, 2:15 am - Quokka: ya thats true i agree with that totally
16/03/25, 2:17 am - ~ Buba: So u r saying in relationship your rational side gets overpowered by the emotional side is it?
16/03/25, 2:17 am - Quokka: ya sometimes
16/03/25, 2:17 am - Quokka: manier times
16/03/25, 2:17 am - ~ Buba: So what's wrong in that?
16/03/25, 2:18 am - ~ Buba: This is what makes u different
16/03/25, 2:18 am - ~ Buba: But ya this might have a bad toll on u if u r continuously operating with just emotion, if u r with wrong guy
16/03/25, 2:19 am - ~ Buba: But at the end of the day you have to decide how you want to live this life...
16/03/25, 2:23 am - Quokka: i don't know but i m afraid of this 
this a feeling a strong feeling 
when i got so emotional i get fear of rejection, disrespect nd all.
i think it just a past trauma 
or negative validation of what i have done.
it should have gone with time but right now i m realizing that it hasn't
nd its what bothering me
16/03/25, 2:23 am - ~ Buba: I feel being totally emotional is almost impossible, your
Rational mind is always there behind the scene. But yeah this is my understanding.

You are strong and wise enough to think about yourself. I can never overpower my thinking on you. U have to decide at the end of the day whether you want to show me that private space of yours or not. I totally respect your decision
16/03/25, 2:25 am - Quokka: yaa thats right i can understand that on each nd every action of emotional being there a watch of me that i need to be in this manner nd all so ya agree that its always there
16/03/25, 2:26 am - ~ Buba: I know, I was shattered in my toxic relationship. Can't describe how I used to feel, already feeling watery eyes while thinking about those time. So ya I know what u r talking about. But that's wht i believed these things teach u like immense things....what you should and what you shouldn't, I a happy that we are discussing this very difficult conversation now.
16/03/25, 2:30 am - ~ Buba: Two things - u will never get disrespect from me & I will share you every 
 feeling I am having before taking any decision cause that's what give me an edge  as on this relationship it's not only my power it's our relationship so before taking any steps both of us should be having consent... Just like how we r able to do it right now
16/03/25, 2:30 am - Quokka: yaa its too hard to stay with those moments, the break down points nd all but ya i know many things that i can avoid to make things better for me nd my partner now. so ya it was hurtful but was helpful too
16/03/25, 2:31 am - ~ Buba: & I expect the same transparency from u
16/03/25, 2:32 am - ~ Buba: In order to make me feel better don't hide any feelings of your. Just discuss it does not matter how difficult it is, cause feeling not discussed initially can be root cause of more big level of suffering in later part of relationship.
16/03/25, 2:33 am - ~ Buba: So it's just like how u say about a disease...earlier it's diagnosed better it is...doesn't matter how difficult it is
16/03/25, 2:33 am - Quokka: yaa we really need this 
these is two of us not only me or you 
it should be like this only whatever it will be it should be discussed nd it have to be our decision on everything 
ya we can make  someone understand it but it should be involving both of us all the time
16/03/25, 2:34 am - ~ Buba: So be as transparent with me as you can - that is the only thing I want from you...no layering nothing.
16/03/25, 2:35 am - ~ Buba: The moment you feel u r feeling something - good or bad, we can definitely discuss <This message was edited>
16/03/25, 2:37 am - Quokka: yes indeed 
one more thing i need to mention that its like really important to me 
i know we dont always do stuff for validation or appreciation but its an important mesure for me 
not necessarily all the time but sometimes it should be there
16/03/25, 2:37 am - ~ Buba: But remember all of this is my understanding and you can have other opinios and I respect that.
16/03/25, 2:37 am - Quokka: i have the same opinion on all of these
16/03/25, 2:39 am - ~ Buba: ☺️who doesn't want validation dude ..deepdown every one wants it, if someone claims that don't need it, either they have already reach very high intellect level or either they don't know themselves too well.

Who does not like getting compliments...everyone likes it.
16/03/25, 2:40 am - Quokka: uuuffffffffffff then thats fine if you think like this about it

16/03/25, 2:45 am - ~ Buba: Miss Trivedi, it was a good conversation after all...I hope you got your answers.....what I like the most was I had the same set of questions last afternoon, which made me work a bit on it to come at peace..seems we are at good frequency as we both are having same sets of questions almost at similar time

16/03/25, 11:56 am - Quokka: heyy
16/03/25, 11:56 am - ~ Buba: That's why I always question many social institutions we have in our society. 

Look as per them, these would have been very peaceful family as everything is matched, caste, religion, gotra, kundli etc as I suppose these must have been an arrange marriage, but it doesn't work like that, two people who are involved in a marriage should be compatible to each other mentally,  rest of the thing can wait. 
Cause when someone's mentally disturbed that is the worst thing that can happen to a human body doesn't matter how physically healthy & wealthy they are.

But yeah I respect someone's belief system. But I haven't found anyone who can explain to me all these logically
16/03/25, 11:59 am - ~ Buba: I started questioning all these since in some of my distant family I saw whole family getting disturbed and destroyed due to lost of mental peace...it was so painful even for us despite being too far family just as looking at human being in such a pathetic situations 

since then I always start questioning society until they explain me logically
16/03/25, 11:59 am - Quokka: they can not
16/03/25, 12:00 pm - Quokka: because i can't be explained
16/03/25, 12:01 pm - ~ Buba: I mean what's the fault of that young kid, he is innocent, he has just started to look at everything in the world & first thing he saw is this feud in family....that's so  painful
16/03/25, 12:02 pm - Quokka: there is nothing to explain.
its just their own stuff which they can not handle nd forced on the family (one person who can commands everyone)
16/03/25, 12:02 pm - ~ Buba: Hmm right
16/03/25, 12:04 pm - Quokka: he always will have some trust issues nd this is like trauma to him
16/03/25, 12:04 pm - ~ Buba: Exactly
16/03/25, 12:05 pm - Quokka: in every relationship of his it reflects
16/03/25, 12:06 pm - ~ Buba: Poor guy..hope he finds his solid back soon

16/03/25, 12:46 pm - ~ Buba: Well technically it's not pure pitbull... keeping pure breed is banned in india so there are many outlet in india which has hybrid breeds for example rocky is hybrid of pitbull & rottweiler, but dominant gene is from his father that is pitbull..so yeah definitely it looks scary, but it has been trained like shit, if u see it's video of getting trained u will feel sorry for him that he has to go through that much🤣🤣...but yeah this had made it extremely easy for us to handle him

18/03/25, 9:27 am - ~ Buba: U can call me whenever u want...
18/03/25, 5:51 pm - Quokka: After reaching here now its time to talk about love 
its kind of a escapism from what i am feeling 
its like telling things which i wasn't so aware about

so there are basically 2 things in love according to me 
the first what you can do for love
nd the second what you should do for love

what you can do is literally anything .
you can do anything for this trust me you go beyond everything.
and it may sound scary but if you love someone its like breathing ;seamless.
you want to see them happy, progressive and most importantly healthy you can do whatever it takes to make them healthy because you can not see them in pain nd physical pain is one you can take control over so yes you do stuff for that.
you stay there for them no matter what the situation is 
your behavior will be changed, a little cringe i guess for them cause somewhere we all know that cringe leads to smile (mostly a sarcastic one but it does)
your approach towards future changes because now they are with you 
you constantly making space for them 
you change some of your habits for them to make them feel comfortable.
and there is a other thing comes with it EXPECTATIONS nothing more but expecting the same things which you are doing. 
quite fair thing no!!!! 
nooo not at all mannnn there's the catch 😄😄😄😄
when you do it you should know that you are cooked😌
we will talk in detail about this later on.....
just focus on the title here
what you can do!!!!!
you shine
you smile
you dance 
you sing
you follow
you notice
you consider
you pray
you stay
you care
every possible thing you can do.
yes ! you fight
you cry
you beg
you drag
you literally make life hard for them sometimes,
nd ya i know we can justify it but the silent factor is EXPECTATION only😶 




Now let us come to what you should do for love.... ummm kind of interesting 
 
what i have experienced is you just let them be , let them be their selves 
let yourself be yourself 
make some boundaries 
make some confessions on that things which you cant have control on i mean to say is you can not tolerate or you can not stand 
let them know what make you uncomfortable 
try to know them 
try to learn them
respect their privacy
respect their decision 
just be there nd your job is done
let them grow around you let yourself grow
discuss your belief 
discuss your idea of love
rather than expecting too much or giving too much just be calm nd happy and blossom 
yes you should be aware of their intensions but most of the times it will be pure 
just don't let yourself fall 
you should walk through love 
grab the hand of your loved once and walk, explore.
you will be amazed how it flows if you do this
its too hard to do but i think its a right thing to do
what we want from a person lets say our parents what we want ??support right!! in every situation we want them to be on our side then we should support them whenever they need it.
( here them mean your loved once)
and they will be supportive you if they love you its a natural things Bhai ye aa hi jaata he support and care kahi se bhi aata he😌🌸




as we mention earlier you want to make them happy but at what cost that you need to manage 
if you do stuff that makes you feel bad nd still you are doing it will be the worst thing you can do to your relationship.
of course i m not talking about sacrifice here that i know at some point we all do for love we should do it.
but there should be a clear line a visible clear line beyond that you should not keep doing it it will cost you your peace at the end.


 then the main question arrives that what should we expect ? its your partner no you should expect something from them!!!!
 then my answer will be what you can do is expect yourself to be you. to find its own happiness,  find its own purpose of life,  enjoy your own company 
if you will be you na , you will be free from every burden nd you will enjoy the company. 
be emotionally dependent on someone makes us a little restless 
but ever we thought how that someone feels ,how much burden they will feel if they know that each nd every smallest thing will affect someone deeply 
its so scary really you can not be yourself and whenever you don't feel liberated you quit everybody quits.

so i and if you read this and you are in love both will try to avoid what we can do and start doing what we should do for love🌸

so yes right now i can write this much nd its my take on love❤️

19/03/25, 11:36 am - ~ Buba: Now let's imagine you are the elder sister and your current sister is your younger sister.

Your age is 28 and you are matured in every sense & married to me😊. And your sister is 22 years old trying to figure out relationship. Answer following questions <This message was edited>
19/03/25, 11:38 am - ~ Buba: Ready?
19/03/25, 11:38 am - Quokka: yess

19/03/25, 11:43 am - Quokka: shyam
19/03/25, 11:43 am - Quokka: he was a really good man
19/03/25, 11:46 am - ~ Buba: What are the kinds of characteristics that there must be having in the guy that will be dating your sis? Kind of checklist
19/03/25, 11:48 am - Quokka: he should be male i guess😂😂😂😂😂
19/03/25, 11:48 am - Quokka: koi ladki nahi chalegi
19/03/25, 11:49 am - ~ Buba: <Media omitted>
19/03/25, 11:50 am - ~ Buba: Likhte likhte thak jyegi, I know
19/03/25, 11:50 am - ~ Buba: Bhot broad open ended question hain...
19/03/25, 11:51 am - Quokka: respectful hona chahiye towards my sister 
responsible 
then kind of a man jo apne future ko leke serious ho
he should be having guts of facing difficulties 
he has to have some boundaries to friends and family when it comes to their relationship 
i mean sabke saamne he has to support her
19/03/25, 11:51 am - Quokka: bohot he yaar wese to
19/03/25, 11:52 am - ~ Buba: Ya ya I understand that..
19/03/25, 11:54 am - Quokka: in short he should be like this , in front of him my sister can be fully feminine she can fully express herself 
he gives efforts without asking
19/03/25, 11:54 am - ~ Buba: Kundli nai milni chahiye? 
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
19/03/25, 11:54 am - Quokka: i don't believe in that par agar wo bhi mil jay to to phir
19/03/25, 11:55 am - Quokka: nd yes decent family honi chahiye
19/03/25, 11:55 am - Quokka: wo to must he matlab
19/03/25, 11:56 am - Quokka: if they want to do something in future
19/03/25, 11:57 am - ~ Buba: This is important as you know the case of your masi... Fully agree but difficult to know this aspect while in relationship
19/03/25, 11:58 am - ~ Buba: Until unless guy/girl stay in one's family even before marriage I guess
19/03/25, 11:58 am - Quokka: they should talk about it
and you also can assume something from the behavior of that person
19/03/25, 11:59 am - Quokka: its quite impossible with my family so i can not think about it
19/03/25, 11:59 am - ~ Buba: Acha right...
19/03/25, 12:01 pm - ~ Buba: But yeah then the only thing that remains is doing the  discussion
19/03/25, 12:02 pm - Quokka: yaa
19/03/25, 12:02 pm - ~ Buba: Mein atta hu tere ghr pe in order to know your family...teko to jan hi lunga but family..how difficult will it be?
19/03/25, 12:04 pm - ~ Buba: But haan it's 80-20 ratio for me....if you are in the my checklist 80% of time...rest 20% can be little bit adjustable for me as long as you are that much compatible with me
19/03/25, 12:04 pm - Quokka: you feel resistance for sure 
but if they are okay with us to phir nahi hoga but kuchh esa he jo unko achha nahi lagta hum me to you can feel severe resistance 😶
19/03/25, 12:04 pm - Quokka: haa wo to he for me its 70 30
19/03/25, 12:04 pm - ~ Buba: That's the point...you get to know about likes & dislikes of each other
19/03/25, 12:05 pm - ~ Buba: Hmm fair enough
19/03/25, 12:05 pm - ~ Buba: Sorry not each other...it's each other's family
19/03/25, 12:08 pm - Quokka: you need be likable for that first  nd then they will allow you to stay

19/03/25, 12:12 pm - ~ Buba: Sachi?

19/03/25, 12:14 pm - ~ Buba: Why is that?
19/03/25, 12:14 pm - Quokka: i didn't like any of them
19/03/25, 12:14 pm - Quokka: kuchh na kuchh to hota hi he red flag jesa
19/03/25, 12:15 pm - ~ Buba: 😅 fair enough
19/03/25, 12:15 pm - Quokka: if i have to i choose a man like you for her🙃🙃
19/03/25, 12:17 pm - Quokka: ❤️❤️
19/03/25, 12:24 pm - ~ Buba: I'm just saying this, think about it a bit & u will understand it..:   "some guys take a very beautiful, innocent, kind girl and hide it away permanently from the rest of the world" <This message was edited>
19/03/25, 12:25 pm - Quokka: you mean world!?
19/03/25, 12:25 pm - ~ Buba: Yeah,  it's world
19/03/25, 12:28 pm - Quokka: i read ut nd it seems to have 2 meaning 
1 in a good way nd 2nd in a terrible way

19/03/25, 12:31 pm - Quokka: okayy i thought that guy take a girl from this terrible world nd make her queen nd build a new world for her so she doesn't need any thing else
19/03/25, 12:33 pm - ~ Buba: Think harder,  "hide her away" : a guy does not have to hide a girl, he just has to give her enough support & power so that she has a strength to do anything she wants knowing that she has a pillar standing behind her.......

So think a bit more time to understand the line
19/03/25, 12:34 pm - Quokka: that negative to samji hi thi me

I don't need a lot of things
I can get by with nothing
With all the blessings life can bring
I've always needed something
But I've got all I want
When it comes to loving you
You're my only reason
You're my only truth
I need you like water
Like breath, like rain
I need you like mercy
From heaven's gate
There's a freedom in your arms
That carries me through
I need you (dada, dada, da), ooh
Ooh
You're the hope that moves me
To courage again, oh yeah
You're the love that rescues me
When the cold winds rage
And it's so amazing
'Cause that's just how you are
And I can't turn back now
'Cause you've brought me too far
I need you like water
Like breath, like rain
I need you like mercy
From Heaven's gate
There's a freedom in your arms
That carries me through
I need you
Ooh, yes I do, oh
I need you like water
Like breath, like rain
I need you like mercy
From Heaven's gate
There's a freedom in your arms
That carries me through
I need you (dada, dada, da)
Oh, yes I do (dada, dada, da)
I need you (dada, dada, da)
Oh, ooh-ooh (dada, dada, da)
Ooh-ooh (dada, dada, da)
I need you, oh (dada, dada, da)
(Dada, dada, da)
I need you (dada, dada, da

Thike thike thana thane de aur kaam krne de <This message was edited>
03/04/25, 5:16 pm - Quokka: Yes i want him
Yes really i do
I just let him do everything he wants
I could imagine his hands floating over me teasing me
His breathe taking me away from me
His soft voice just like pinching thousands of needles in my stomach 
The way he is grabbing my waist nd pulling me Over i can not hold my self now
I want to slip with the flow of fascination nd intense affection.
He is bitting his lips touching it with his teeth it lifts me so high
Soft kisses nd a bite on my pinna making me do such things that i couldn't have imagined
I know its my fault to feel like this 
But i m just slipping on lubercious floor that he made for me to fall
I couldn't give the promise to be with him whole my life or ill be his for life or we are going to grow old together but yeah still i want him beyond the reality nd sense of present phase of my life 
You can see me as a bitch but its okay for me to called so because i m skidding like anything 
I just want to be here this is what i called a greasy imagination or passionate intimacy.
I just want to stare his eye and plunge into the ocean that i couldn't be found 
I just want myself to see by the sight of the man who actually proud of me for being me calls me sexy even if i m having insecurities about myself
I just want him to take power of everything nd let me drag into his existence.
Yes i m feeling guilty but if the true solicitude counts then how righteous i m you can see.
Yes there are many things to discuss but when i see him adoring me i forgot everything nd stirring stimulation hits me hard.
Nd then evidently notice his lingually placed teeth roll over the lip his hair buoyant in air his keen jowline nd sleepy voice briskly take me to the pinnacle.

03/04/25, 11:11 pm - ~ Buba: Baby it's your past...u should let everything go....why do u still hold all those things so close to u...

I will tell u today about it on call, this might will hurt u, but u won't be able to deny my logic
03/04/25, 11:11 pm - ~ Buba: Why do those things have power to affect u...keep your power to yourself, don't let any other things take control over u...
03/04/25, 11:13 pm - ~ Buba: If I m with u, u shouldn't be bother about whatever has happened in past, cause u know I m with u at all stage......

In some sense it's disrespect to what we have between each other, it's disrespect for u, it's disrespect to me that I have not become eligible enough to take those place or let u go through those feelings
03/04/25, 11:15 pm - ~ Buba: Our future is what matters. I want to be the one who helps you heal, who makes you forget the past and look forward to tomorrow. I promise you, I'll be here for you every step of the way.

But u have to let go of all those past feelings otherwise how will this work?
03/04/25, 11:16 pm - ~ Buba: I told u that we will discuss serious matters on vc, not on text or call...so just wants to make u feel happy or annoy u on the way <This message was edited>
03/04/25, 11:18 pm - ~ Buba: Just tell me how u will feel if I tell u, that even after having such a beautiful relationship, I can't come out of my past, my past comes to me everyday, even a single discussion takes me back there.....u r not enough to make me forget my past...

03/04/25, 11:38 pm - Quokka: yaa because when i was into that i poured myself 
so it has power
it has power to remind me that what did happened where i was wrong where i get wronged 
where to improve where to let go where to hold tight nd all
03/04/25, 11:39 pm - Quokka: nd that fling was the most regretful thing i have ever done so i will be hurtful for life

No need to worry about anything just a cautionary thing.

06/04/25, 5:54 pm - ~ Buba: Jab mene tujhse baat ki tb Jismo mein uljne se pehle, main teri zulfon mein uljna chahta tha

Tere aankhon ka har aansoo mere kameez pe behna chahta hoon

Apne kapdon ko be-parda hone se pehle, maine apne sare raaz tere saamne khol diye hain



Mujhe tumse pyaar hai, kyunki tum woh ho jo be-khauf apne dil ki baatein mere saamne kehti ho

Apne sare darr, apni sabhi chintaein, sab kuchh mere saamne rakhti ho


Mujhe ehsaas ho raha hai ki main tumhe kahi jaane nahin de sakta, kyunki
Aisi mohabbat milne mein maine zindagi ka kafi lamha beet gaya hai
Aur ab, tumhari zaroorat mere liye sabse zyada hai <This message was edited>

07/04/25, 4:49 pm - ~ Buba: Baby, I've been thinking a lot about what happened, and I wanted to apologize again for making you cry and worrying about your health. Seeing you like that broke my heart, and I'm still feeling guilty about it.

Every moment we've shared physically and mentally has been etched in my memory. Seeing you cry and worrying about your health was like a punch to my gut – it hurt more than I can put into words.

I want to be your rock, your safe haven, and your home 🏠, where u can be yourself always. 

 I'll be here with you, holding your hand through it all, even if it's just in spirit. You're not alone in any matter– we're in this together, always.

 I'm not going anywhere. You're the one I want to be with, and I'm here to support you through all the ups and downs.

I promise to be more understanding and patient in the future. Your happiness and well-being mean everything to me, and I don't want to ever cause you pain or distress again.

Take care of yourself and your health, my love. I'm here for you, always. 💕"

08/04/25, 4:50 pm - ~ Buba: Those frequent kisses from your tender and soft lips are etched in my memory, and I'm craving the taste of your sweet mouth again. 
Your hair, oh your hair, it's like a work of art that I want to touch, feel, and play with every moment. The way it cascades down your face, framing your beautiful face, is a sight I can never get enough of.

Your arms, so delicate yet strong, are the ones I want to hold onto right now. I long to wrap them around me, feeling the warmth and love that only you can give. Your palms, so small and soft, are like a gentle breeze on a summer day – a soothing balm for my soul & body ....

Even the playful slaps you give me make my heart skip a beat, and I'm hopelessly in love with the way you use them to show your affection. Your expressions, oh your expressions, they're like a work of art that speaks a thousand words. Your mouth may be silent, but your eyes, your eyebrows, and your smile convey everything I need to know.

I'm missing your sparkling chinese eyes, I'm missing your sweet nose, which scrunches up when you're laughing or concentrating. I'm missing your cheeks, which blush with excitement whenever we're together. I'm missing your neck, which is so elegant and refined. I'm missing your shoulders and legs, which always want my touch to make them at ease..

I'm missing your hands, which are so gentle and caring. I'm missing your fingers, which are long and slender. I'm missing your waist, which is so slender and delicate. I'm missing your hips, which are curvy and beautiful.

I'm missing every inch of you, every curve, every contour, every part of your beautiful body. I'm missing the way you move, the way you laugh, the way you smile. I'm missing the way you make me feel when we're together – like I'm home, like I'm exactly where I'm meant to be.

I love you, my darling, every part of you, every inch of you. You're the missing piece I never knew I needed.

10/04/25, 12:50 pm - ~ Buba: i want to love u
until your shame becomes a language
U forgets how to speak.
until your thighs remember
they are altars.
until your heart beats
loud enough to call the gods home.
love is not polite in my chest.
it wrecks the furniture.
it spills the wine.
it leaves bruises in places no doctor can reach.
but my god,
it makes the whole of me go made

I want u to taste that power on my tongue 
I want to feast fire in u, like it's last supper of my soul 
I want to love u like forest catches fire to make it fertile again 
Your wild is not a danger,
It's the medicine I am born to swallow
10/04/25, 12:55 pm - Quokka: you are not helping a bit
i m not able to speak anything 
not able to relax my contractions 
not able to clam my shivers 
not able to hold the hankering to do everything with you
10/04/25, 1:01 pm - ~ Buba: I hear every unspoken word behind your silence and feel every shiver that escapes when words fail. I want you to know that every pause, every trembling moment, is like a secret language between us—one that speaks of a hunger beyond speech. When your body trembles and your heart races, it tells me that our connection is as raw and powerful as the world itself. Let those sensations guide you, and know that I'm here—ready to explore every quiet, burning desire with you
10/04/25, 1:04 pm - Quokka: i m literally powerless right now to do anything
10/04/25, 1:05 pm - Quokka: i just want you to take everything under your control nd let me dive into your deepest darkest innerself
10/04/25, 1:12 pm - ~ Buba: I'm realising that your sexual energy burns far brighter than I ever imagined—it’s like a brilliant beacon, igniting a spark of hope and possibility in the most unexpected ways & this is what I want...

12/04/25, 12:12 am - ~ Buba: One month down, forever to go? Here's how I knew you were the one:

You're my calm in the chaos, my softness in a world that demands I be loud. You've shown me feelings I never thought I'd experience. With you, I feel brand new - my smiles are deeper, my emotions are more intense, and my love is louder.

Your messages have the power to change my mood, even on my worst days. When I'm pretending to be okay, one message from you makes me smile. You're that powerful.

What means the most to me is that you didn't give up on us, even when I did. You knocked on my door when I closed it, waited when I went quiet, and stayed when I thought no one would. Your persistence, patience, and love mean everything to me.

I can be my true self around you, sharing my thoughts and fears without worrying you'll run away. In a world full of temporary connections, I hope we can build something permanent. You're not just here for the highs; you've stayed through the lows, the mistakes, and the imperfections. That's how I know you're different, and that's why I think we could have something special.


With u im something completely different...I never knew something like this also exist in me....

Maybe we can make this one month mark the beginning of forever?

12/04/25, 12:32 am - Quokka: just ask me again
12/04/25, 12:47 am - ~ Buba: There’s a kind of peace I never knew I needed
until I found it in your arms.
The way you look at me—
soft, like I’m something sacred—
makes my heart slow down and speed up
at the same time.

Your laugh wraps around me like sunlight,
your touch—gentle,
yet it lingers like a kiss that never really ends.
And when you rest your head on my chest,
I swear, the world stops turning for a little while.

Being with you feels like poetry whispered in candlelight.
Like Sunday mornings tangled in sheets,
where love isn't rushed—
it's explored.
It’s hands that take their time,
lips that speak without words,
and sighs that say more than promises ever could.

You make me want to love softer,
deeper,
longer.
Not just in moments when the lights are low—
but in everything.
In the way I hold your hand,
the way I kiss your forehead,
the way I pull you closer when you least expect it.

I am imagining  
my fingers tracing lazy patterns along your skin,
I feel it with every beat of my heart—

"I think I have found my person in you,
What do you say, let's take it to the next level..."

Let’s build something beautiful,
something that lasts beyond the fire of now.
Let me wake up to your sleepy smile,
hold you through the quiet and the chaos,
make love to you like it’s the first time,
every time.

You’re not just my desire—
you’re my peace,
my favorite hello,
my forever if you’ll have me.

12/04/25, 10:05 pm - ~ Buba: Areee, we all have something....we all need to improve on something...let's do it together
12/04/25, 10:06 pm - Quokka: 🥺🥺🥺🥺

12/04/25, 10:12 pm - ~ Buba: U r worth it, 
Always!
U r worth the wait, the distance, the moments, the days,
U r worth everything ....

If I would have been granted three wishes, it would be u & u & u every time without hesitation cause rest of the things I will build again, holding your hands & when I know my home is with me.....


Your smile doesn't just make u beautiful, but everything around u, everyone near u...Keep smiling never stop cause your smile make the world a better place....

They tell me I have lots of courage and arrogance,
But in reality I never choose it, 
I just wish I didn't have to have it...


&& That's what u give me, 

all the mirrors in this world have shown me reflection of my physical self...while u have shown me reflection of my soul, showing me what I am within this hard shell of mine...

Talking about improvement in ourselves, this is the reason we build relationships so that we improve each other mentally, emotionally & physically.....
12/04/25, 10:13 pm - ~ Buba: Now I love u more for this...more u share with me, more I get in love with u...don't know how but it's just working like this only....
12/04/25, 10:17 pm - ~ Buba: There is nothing wrong with the traits that u have....Ideal traits have to be like how u have that is nothing to expect just deliverance to the one in needs without asking for anything..,..it's just that we r currently living in this phase of time that even in order for u to be righteous and carry out charity, u need some financial support...

 but Don't worry we r in this together ......always!

13/04/25, 11:57 am - Quokka: please tell me
13/04/25, 11:59 am - ~ Buba: U r the one that means everything to me,

U r the silent reassurance admist all the chaos life bring to me

U r someone, I had easily find in a crowd of hundreds of thousands of people..just the way u have found me from piles & piles of people in your life ..

U r the playlist I had wanted to listen to forever,

U r the loving picture of love i always imagined love world look and feel like,

U r my north start (guide).. The constant source of light that keeps the darkness away when road ahead feels too difficult to navigate

U r a dream I had choose over reality, every single time. For the rest of my life!

U r my poetry ,
the words god wrote for me,
the ink that bleeds feelings,
deep into my existence 

U r the love letter god wrote for me,


U r my sunshine on days that feel too heavy to survive,
U r the rain that pours peace over me, when my heart become too cloud with  vulnerabilities,
U r someone I would want to live thousands of years for & want to left this world instantly when u do,
U r my safe heaven, a soul I would protect at any cost,

U r someone who bring so much positivity into my life, that it heals not just me, but everyone around me, people I have never knows, I have never met!


U exist in sacred, silent dimension of my heart
I want to protect u from this cruel world
U have become inseparable part of my thoughts,
Time can't catch u, distance can't fade u,
& Even if world turn it's back on me,
I know your presence would still feel like home,
U r someone I had wreck havoc for in the lives of those who dared to hurt u,
Loving u isn't just feeling it has become part of my being 


U r the one I would build bridges for to take u to place closure to my heart, a place I have kept distant from rest of the world
U r someone who brought life back into me



I wonder do u feel the same do me......
(There is no question mark in the end, I m not asking, it's a thought)
13/04/25, 12:07 pm - ~ Buba: I had never thought that i would be able to express my feelings like this before I met u ....just thinking about u would let me access that part of my being that all words just flew, no efforts required, all coming from thought of u .....

I guess we both r feeling something about each other that we never have felt before, never have done before...do u agree... honestly
13/04/25, 12:11 pm - Quokka: yes i agree 
but i m scared 
its too early i know its too pure but what if you come to know this is just excitement if new beginning not a new you

13/04/25, 12:16 pm - Quokka: i m sorry if you get hurt by this i m sorry
13/04/25, 12:16 pm - ~ Buba: It's alright, but remember this is how I love..when I decides to love someone
13/04/25, 12:18 pm - ~ Buba: Also wanted to apologize for not being able to spend as much time together lately. I know how much we both cherish our moments, and I'm truly sorry for missing out on some special times. As you know, being an athlete requires a lot of dedication and time to grow in the sport, and balancing it with my professional life can get overwhelming. Right now, I'm in a phase where there's so much to learn and achieve, but please know that you're always on my mind and in my heart. I hope you understand the demands of my sport and my career, and I promise to make it up to you soon. 

You're my priority, and I'm committed to finding a better balance that works for both of us.

But yeah u know me I can't see u get hurt, so even if this is too much for u ....let me know, we will figure it out...... <This message was edited>

my dentist
13/04/25, 1:05 pm - Quokka: 😄😄😄😄
13/04/25, 1:19 pm - ~ Buba: Sometime i think that loving you is the only thing i was ever meant to do,
And yet it's the hardest task I have ever undertaken,
I sit here in my room,
the day pressing against the window,
And I imagine u,
Your face,
Your hand,
The way u might smile and dance at something I have said,
And it's as if my whole being leaps towards you across the miles of our distance,
I want to be with you,
Not just in texts,
Not just in dreams,
but truly to sit besides u and feeling your warmth,
to know that the longing I feel for u isn't a burden, but a gift,
Do u know what it's feel like to love someone that it hurts, that it feels like a wound and a joy at a same time?
I don't know if I can bear it and yet i wouldn't trade it for anything ...........................
13/04/25, 1:20 pm - ~ Buba: I love u my cute little gangsta dentist....

13/04/25, 2:16 pm - ~ Buba: He will have to atleast disable this sim in order to cut the contact...but this stupid guy also gave bank details...so he is almost caught until and unless he disable his sim & bank both

13/04/25, 2:25 pm - ~ Buba: I mean my intention was to provoke him to abuse me so that I can register a complain...but that complaint would have been weak...so made sure to contact one of a policeman I know from my area, so that complaint can be strong of abusing to police... <This message was edited>

13/04/25, 8:47 pm - ~ Buba: I didn't notice the outfits as much as I noticed how quickly I could imagine you out of them. 😉 


..just kidding, it was like a series of performances and my rating for all of them is in the same order as u wear it...u started with kurti, green, pink, black and that last shirt of yours...my god! Simply taken my breath away.....what I really liked about all of them was that all of them are traditional with western style pinch.....but to be honest it's not that u r looking good on them, it's like they are looking good on u.......

U don't know how good they look on u....
13/04/25, 8:48 pm - ~ Buba: It's really hard for me to stay here after looking at u like that
13/04/25, 8:49 pm - Quokka: i m telling you come to me as soon as possible
13/04/25, 8:49 pm - Quokka: kabhi kabhi i really feel that you are hyping the way i look
13/04/25, 8:51 pm - ~ Buba: When I say that u look gorgeous u r.... believe me, I will tell straight to your face the way u look....
But u woman, u r just slaying me every time I look at u....just look yourself in a mirror once, u will realise how beautiful u r....
13/04/25, 8:52 pm - Quokka: see you did it again
13/04/25, 8:53 pm - ~ Buba: Thik hain, nai manna to matt mann....apni lesbian friend ko puch, wo jbb btayegi tb manegi tu hain na
13/04/25, 8:53 pm - Quokka: 😂😂😂😂

13/04/25, 8:55 pm - Quokka: seriously!!!!
13/04/25, 8:55 pm - Quokka: what if i fat up like 90 kg pr shrink down?!
13/04/25, 8:56 pm - ~ Buba: Teko hone hi nai dunga mein...u know me na🤣🤣🤣
13/04/25, 8:58 pm - Quokka: what if koi medical condition ki wajah se ho jae
13/04/25, 8:58 pm - Quokka: !!!!
13/04/25, 8:58 pm - ~ Buba: Of course, I'm human after all and I see everything.....

but u really don't have to worry about that, u r sexy believe me....
13/04/25, 8:59 pm - Quokka: .......
13/04/25, 8:59 pm - Quokka: i m worried now
13/04/25, 8:59 pm - Quokka: 😏😏
13/04/25, 9:04 pm - Quokka: heyy
13/04/25, 9:04 pm - Quokka: !!
13/04/25, 9:09 pm - ~ Buba: Really darling.... 

everything starts with a physical appearance.....I already told u that I had looked at your profile when u texted me.........

Once it starts from a physical appearance then one starts to see the emotional capacity of the other and if that matches people fall in love......
I have already fallen in love with u, have described and shown u in every sense earlier but still come on......

No matter what medical conditions come, we both will be together for this......U r sexy rn, I will make sure what we will eat, what we will have to do to keep ourselves look good always, cause at the end of the day I will be the one who will cook right...so if I will take care of your food, take care u emotionally and physically (u know what I mean 😉)..no medical condition can come and even if it comes, we will be with each other to improve every bits of it, isn't it?


Agr abhi tune kbhi apne bare mein upar niche bola to mere se bura koi nai hoga...
13/04/25, 9:10 pm - ~ Buba: My baby
13/04/25, 9:11 pm - Quokka: i was talking about pregnancy or anything like that

what if that happens
13/04/25, 9:11 pm - Quokka: thats true i agree on that
13/04/25, 9:14 pm - ~ Buba: Arey, once things go till there, it's different things all together....it's no longer a guy and girl in a relationship.....it's a bond at that time, which doesn't see physical appearance or anything else...at that time things like loyalty, care, and trust drives everything...I mean look at your parents, look at how other married couples are....after sometime they started to look like each other...it's that strong bond baby....so u r comparing completely two different time frames ..... <This message was edited>

15/04/25, 7:07 pm - Quokka: चीज़ें मैं रख के
भूल जाती हूँ
बे ख्याली में गुनगुनाती हूँ

15/04/25, 7:07 pm - Quokka: exactly esa ho raha he

15/04/25, 7:11 pm - ~ Buba: Each word is as sharp as your stare, 
each word is as sensual as your kiss every time, making me realize the intensity every time... 
I think of u & i feel my heart skip a beat, and I'm lost in the depths of your eyes, where love resides.
15/04/25, 7:13 pm - Quokka: 😶
15/04/25, 7:16 pm - Quokka: how!!!!!!
15/04/25, 7:18 pm - ~ Buba: When we meet, it will be the most sensual, most beautiful moment our hearts have ever known. The world around us will fade, and in that quiet space, it’ll be just you and me — the warmth of your touch, the sweetness of your scent, the softness of your lips against mine. Every glance, every whisper, every brush of your skin will send shivers through my soul.

I’ll savor every second of you in my arms, feeling the rise and fall of your breath, the way your body fits perfectly against mine. It’ll be a night where time stands still — where the only thing that matters is how you make my heart race and my every sense come alive.

I want to lose myself in you, in your eyes, your touch, your taste — to explore every curve, every sigh, every secret space we’ve only dreamed of. It won’t just be a meeting… it’ll be magic, electric, unforgettable.
15/04/25, 7:31 pm - Quokka: i can not express how much excited i m for this
how much i crave for you 
how much i want to slip in that moment 
how much i want to explore you physically mentally nd emotionally.
15/04/25, 7:32 pm - ~ Buba: Listen to me,
This evening I will be a little busy, first I will be visiting physio to check my form & current leg condition, then 
 I need to go to college for encouraging and giving tips  to the IITB team......post that I am planning to take the whole team for dinner ....
So excuse this little discomfort from me...

I will constantly share what's happening or some pics if possible <This message was edited>

it's u which prevents me losing faith in humanity,
 it's u who shivers me, excites me,& show me how much love I can do....


Even a face of yours makes me feel like if this is not it then what it is....

"Ye ishq kii intiha lene lagi imtihaan
Had se guzarane lagi hai meri chaahaten

Just like the moon, I can only appreciate you from afar— not allowed to ascend, not allowed to touch. 
I orbit in silence, pulled by something invisible and tender, watching your light scatter over the dark waters of my longing. 
You do not belong to me, and yet every part of me moves because of you!

But always remember u r mine & mine to have.....

I visited my physician earlier today, and they have advised that I remain under observation for the next 24 to 48 hours to ensure my condition stabilizes.

I realize this is short notice not an ideal time to request for leave, and I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause to our schedule. However, given my current health situation, I’m compelled to take leave.
17/04/25, 10:24 pm - ~ Buba: I am writing to inform you that I have been experiencing severe symptoms, including projectile vomiting, intense headaches, and elevated blood pressure. After consulting with my doctor, I have been advised to remain under medical observation for the next 24 to 48 hours.

I understand that this may not be the most convenient time to request leave, and I sincerely apologize for any disruption my absence may cause. However, due to my current health condition and doctor consultation, I believe it is necessary for me to take time to recover .

I will keep you updated on my progress and inform you promptly of any changes to my situation.

Thank you for your understanding and support during this time.

23/04/25, 4:40 pm - ~ Buba: Subhi,

I want to tell you, without worrying about the consequences.  

I’ve fallen in love with you.  
With the way you speak,  
the way you listen,  
the way you make me feel understood with just a glance.  

I’ve fallen in love with everything you are, even with the parts you struggle to love yourself.  

And I don’t know where all of this will take us, but I do know that, if we truly love each other, we’ll be the kind of love that doesn’t stand still— but grows, expands, and takes us exactly where we’ve always wanted to be.
23/04/25, 5:10 pm - Quokka: i just don't have words

23/04/25, 6:32 pm - ~ Buba: Always!
23/04/25, 6:37 pm - ~ Buba: Remember I am not a guy with momentary feelings & attachments...
Always tell things which you mean...
I always tell you things which I mean as well as have full guys to do so...

I always believe you and I believe you understand what you wrote in this text... But even by 0.01% of the mistake if this is a momentary feelings text, please take it back..

I always take your words seriously...
23/04/25, 6:38 pm - Quokka: do you really think that 
Haven't you seen it in my eyes already!?
23/04/25, 6:40 pm - ~ Buba: I have seen it all over you......

me telling you this?
23/04/25, 6:55 pm - Quokka: or you don't know whether i m too emotional while telling this
after sometime ill not be meaning it
23/04/25, 6:55 pm - Quokka: ?
23/04/25, 7:00 pm - ~ Buba: I'm trying to say...

Take that statement back if u have said it in some emotional condition and later on does not mean it.
23/04/25, 7:06 pm - ~ Buba: I want this message from always....but it has to be from the bottom of your heart with complete surety....
I believe it is & I have seen it you!

But what if it's momentary feelings? Cause if it's so, it has the power to break me...
23/04/25, 7:10 pm - ~ Buba: Cause if you mean it ....think once again, if u really mean it....
Remember that I won't let you go off me, in any frickin case.
23/04/25, 7:11 pm - Quokka: i don't want to
23/04/25, 7:17 pm - Quokka: i mean it 
from the day you hold me
from the day you touched me
from the moment I've seen your eyes
from the moment you cried for me
from the day you kissed me
from the day you changed yourself for me

but i was afraid that you will freak out

You say something so lovin', but
Now I gotta let you go
You'll be better off in someone new

You look so broken when you cry,
One more and then I say goodbye,
Sometimes, all I think about is you....

25/04/25, 10:44 am - Quokka: tell me honestly
25/04/25, 10:50 am - ~ Buba: After realizing the chaos I've created, I'm left humbled and reflective, acknowledging the mistakes of my past. But the sense of peace I felt in today's dream was surreal, almost indescribable. In that moment, everything felt right, and it made me realize how much I yearn for that sense of calm and connection in my waking life. I want to experience life with you by my side, sharing every breath, every moment, every laugh, and every tear. I want to wake up to your smile, fall asleep in your arms, and explore the world together, hand in hand.

Yesterday, today, and tomorrow, I want you to know that you are my everything – my guiding light, my safe haven, my forever love. You bring meaning to my life, and I'm grateful for your presence. I promise to cherish, support, and love you unconditionally, through life's ups and downs. I love you more than words can express, and I look forward to building a future together, creating memories that will last a lifetime.
25/04/25, 10:56 am - ~ Buba: I want you so badly now—
Your memory haunts my every breath,
A sweet ache pulsing through my veins,
No longer mere need, but beautiful obsession.

In the stillness of midnight hours,
Your name becomes my secret prayer,
Each syllable a tender invocation
That stirs the embers of my longing.

I taste your absence on my lips,
A bittersweet flavor I can’t relinquish;
Your phantom touch ignites my skin,
And I burn for you in silent fever.

You dwell in every shadowed corner
Of my restless, dreaming mind—
A siren song I cannot resist,
Dragging me deeper into desire’s tide.

What began as simple wanting
Has blossomed into consuming fire;
I am yours, irrevocably bound
By the sweet torment of obsession.
25/04/25, 11:15 am - Quokka: oh my god
25/04/25, 11:16 am - Quokka: what is this!!!??
25/04/25, 11:16 am - Quokka: tu hi he na kuldeep!?
25/04/25, 11:25 am - ~ Buba: *The Last Request*:




Every word you’ve ever shared with me—your joys, your fears, the storms and sunlight in your heart—has become a part of me. I didn’t understand it fully before, but now I see: when you open up, you’re not asking me to fix anything. You just want me to *be there*. To hold you close, to listen without speaking, to let my arms around you say what words never could. And for trusting me with that sacred space—your heart laid bare—I will always be grateful.  

I’ve realized something profound: love isn’t about having all the answers. It’s about sitting beside you in the quiet, holding your hand when the world feels heavy, and kissing your tears before they fall. It’s about being your safe haven, your shelter, the steady ground beneath your feet when everything else feels shaky.  

So this is my promise to you:  
From now on, I will let you feel everything—freely, fiercely, unapologetically. When you laugh, I’ll laugh with you. When you ache, I’ll ache with you. I’ll never rush to “solve” your pain or dim the brightness of your joy. Instead, I’ll hold you tighter. I’ll listen deeper. I’ll let my silence be a refuge, and my love be a constant whisper: *“I’m here, fully here, for all of you.”*  

You once asked me to never let you lose yourself—but I see now that the *true* gift is getting to witness *every* version of you. The messy, the radiant, the fragile, the unstoppable. I want to know it all. Not because I need to, but because I *crave* it. You are my soulmate, my heartbeat, my greatest lesson in what love really means.  

Please, my love—don’t ever hide from me. Don’t stop sharing your light or your shadows. Let me be the one you turn to, always. Let me spend forever learning the rhythm of your soul, the stories in your silence, the magic of *you*.  

I’m yours, completely. And no matter what storms come, I will never let go of your hand.  

All I ask is that you stay. Stay, and let me prove every day that this heart is yours to keep.
25/04/25, 11:28 am - ~ Buba: This is me, I thought I could never open up on my feelings to anyone besides a few people in my life...But it's you who I have placed not only my trust but myself too...
25/04/25, 11:40 am - ~ Buba: The night I hurt you, I wrote this in my digital diary. For years, I’ve hidden my feelings there, believing that pages and pixels could never hurt me. I thought if I kept my heart locked away, it would stay safe.  

But you’ve changed everything.  
Now, *you* are my diary.  
Not a screen or a page, but a living, breathing safe place.  
When my heart overflows, I don’t scribble it in silence anymore—I give it to *you*.  
When storms rage inside me, I don’t bury them—I let you stand in the rain with me.  

Here’s the truth I need you to hear:  
Even if being this open means I might get hurt, I’d choose you as the reason for that pain.  
Your hands, your voice, your heart—they’re the only place I want to keep my raw, unfiltered self.  
I don’t regret this. Not for a second.  
Because loving you has taught me something:  
It’s better to ache with you than to numb myself alone.  

So here I am—no more hiding.  
My fears, my flaws, my fiercest joys—they’re yours.  
I won’t armor myself with silence anymore.  
If I bleed, let it be into your hands.  
If I fall, let it be toward you.  

Just promise me one thing:  
Never stop being my diary.  
Let me keep writing my truth with you, page by page, heartbeat by heartbeat.  
I’m yours—scars, storms, and all.

And I know my feelings might get hurt by opening up myself completely to you, but still you are that one person I know it will be beautiful and deserve full to do anything to me  

So I have given you the every right to do anything you want -  break me, build me,  hurt me.... whatever u want and u r the only person to have this right.... <This message was edited>

Mujhe sirf tumhe dekhna hian,
Mujhe nai dekhni tumhari little black dress
Ya high hills
Nia nai high hills se darta nia hu 
Kadd mein 6 foot nai hu
Lekin mahobbat main 60 foot se upar hu
Tum ana apne sbse sabut libas mein
Jo night suit wli tshirt tumhe apni maa ne faink dene ko boli this, ek comfortable sa pyajma sadi si chappal
We should look very unusual as a couple
Mein tumhare sath chamak na nai chahta 
Mein bhid mein gum ho jana chahata hu
Mein tumhari taiyaari nai sirf tumhe dekhna chahta hu

Tagore: Jesi ho wesi hi aa jao sringar ko rehne do

Agr tumhare baal bikhre hue hain bikhre ne do, bidgadne do jese tum mujhse bigadti ho

Mujhe acha lagta hian kabhi kabhi jb sirf tum mere liye saverti ho

Jese mujhe sirf tumhe dekhna ahian sirf tumhe poorn ruup se tumhara roop pratiroop swaroop

Jamane k nazirye se chahe wo swaroop ho ya kurup, mujhe farak nai pdta mujhe sirf tumhe dekhna hain

Mujhe tumhe dekhna hain mehnt krte hue, mashakat krte hue, football khetlt hue, khudse ldte hue, scooty pe logo ko gali dete hue

Mujhe tumhe dekhna hain apne streepan se bagawat krte hue, 
Mujhe tumhe dekhna hain samaj se paribhasit mere andar k purush se milawat krte hue

Mujhe sirf tumhe dekhna hain
27/04/25, 1:18 pm - ~ Buba: If words could mend the fractures I’ve caused, I would borrow the eloquence of Neruda’s verses and the steadfastness of Darcy’s resolve to piece back the trust I’ve shattered. You, my muse, deserve nothing less than sonnets woven from sincerity.

In the quiet hours since my misstep, I’ve dwelled in the shadow of regret. Like a discordant note in the symphony we’ve composed, my actions disrupted the harmony we nurtured. I turned the page of our story too roughly, smudging the ink of our shared moments—a careless scribe in our once-pristine narrative. For this, I bear the weight of my folly.

Shakespeare wrote, “Love is not love which alters when it alteration finds.” My love for you, however, faltered in thoughtlessness, casting a frost over the garden we tended. I see now how my words, like unseasonal frost, wilted the blossoms of your trust. Your silence echoes like a verse from Eliot’s waste, a barren ache I’ve brought upon us both.

Yet, in this ache, I vow to rewrite our future. With the humility of Austen’s heroes, I pledge to tend our bond with patience and grace, where understanding reigns. Let me learn the language of your heart anew, each word a step toward redemption. I will be the gardener who nurtures every seedling of hope, shielding it from storms I once stirred.

I ask not for immediate forgiveness but the chance to prove my penance. Let us author a chapter where growth springs from regret, and dawn breaks gently over our horizon. Your pain is my lesson, your grace my compass. <This message was edited>
27/04/25, 1:47 pm - ~ Buba: You have asked me to be open about everything I'm feeling isn't it ...so here I'm :

I need to ask something of you—a plea, not a demand.  

When you call this *artificial*,  

when you whisper 
*“I’m unsure,”*  

when you wonder if loneliness—not love—guides your heart…  

those words fall like stones into the quiet waters between us.  

You see, I hold your voice as something sacred.  
Each syllable you share roots itself in me,  
growing vines that tangle hope and fear alike.  

But when you doubt what we’ve nurtured,  
it feels like upending the soil we’ve both tended—  
leaving our garden exposed to frost.  

I won’t pretend your uncertainty doesn’t fracture me.  

How could it not?  

You are not a placeholder for loneliness.  

You are Surbhi—*my* Surbhi—  
the one who laughs in italics and argues in bold,  
the one whose absence would leave my world in grayscale.  

So here is my truth, naked and unguarded:  
I cannot love a ghost of you.  
But I *will* stand here, stubborn as sunrise,  
waiting for the woman who once trusted me  
with her unedited heart.  
If the truth of “us” still lives in you,  
then let’s rebuild it—stone by stone, word by word.  

But if doubt is all that remains…  
tell me plainly.  
Even silence would hurt less than half-meant promises. 

I love you from all my heart but at the same time I want to  disappear from your life if you think I'm in need of pity love, 
I'm in need of emotional support from you but not on this front where you think you want me to see at a better place so you are dragging it at your own cost...

Every time I want you to be selfish with me, clearly state me what you want and what you not.. 


Be your own self in this relationship, 
claim what you want 



So even if a single statement whatever you have told me on call meant it for you...
do let me know,

Cause if it does & you are burying your doubts to spare me pain,
In future, It will become like a  serpents venome in my each of my veins...
27/04/25, 1:50 pm - Quokka: it was pure anger nd dissatisfaction
27/04/25, 1:52 pm - Quokka: yaa i was unsure because you were acting like i m not that person for you in front of you can be like raw nd your trueself
i was angry that after explaining this much you are not understanding
27/04/25, 1:52 pm - Quokka: i figured that loneliness is a big factor here but i don't want to be lonely but if esa hota me tuje kabhi confront karti hi nahi
27/04/25, 1:53 pm - Quokka: see my trust that you never hurt me is shaken ofc you know that
27/04/25, 1:54 pm - Quokka: so it will take time to be 100% sure 
but I'd like to give it chances many more may be because i want you i want to be with you 
i want you tk be that man for me which i ever wished for
27/04/25, 1:58 pm - ~ Buba: I hear you. Truly.  

When you say I hid my raw self from you, I feel the weight of that truth like a stone in my throat. You deserved more than the half-shadow version of me—the one who feared that vulnerability might push you away. But I see now how that silence became a wall, and I’m sorry for making you doubt your place in my heart. You *are* my sanctuary, the one I want to unravel for, even when the threads are messy.  

Your anger cuts deep, but it’s deserved. I’ve been a slow student in learning your language, too busy defending my own fears to hear the ache beneath your words. Loneliness isn’t why I’m here. I’m here because *you* are my compass—not a placeholder, not a cure, but the quiet fire that makes every uncertain step worth taking.  

I know trust isn’t rebuilt in a day. It’s a slow sunrise, and I’ll stand in the dark as long as it takes, proving through every stumble that I’m not the man who hurt you—but the one who’s learning to love you better.  

You said you want to give “us” more chances. That’s all I ask for: the grace to grow into the man you’ve wished for. But promise me this—be selfish. Tell me when I falter, scream when I’m dense, and demand the truth you deserve. I’ll do the same. No more half-lights or hollow comforts. Just raw, imperfect trying.  

If you’ll still have me, I’m yours. Not out of loneliness, but because I choose you—again and again, storm or stillness.
27/04/25, 2:00 pm - Quokka: yes!
27/04/25, 2:00 pm - Quokka: i always confront you instead of being fake

how bad i m <This message was edited>
28/04/25, 10:19 am - Quokka: nd when i feel like it i can not do anything 
kuchh bhi nahi
sab khatam ho jata he
28/04/25, 10:19 am - Quokka: sab
28/04/25, 10:39 am - ~ Buba: Everything you’re feeling is valid, and I want you to know you’re *not* alone in this. Those moments of losing control, the guilt, the confusion with Shyam and Hrishi—they don’t define your worth. You are not "bad," and your dignity is **not** lost. You’re human, navigating emotions that are messy and overwhelming, and that’s okay.  

This isn’t about forgetting the past or forcing yourself to erase what happened. Healing isn’t linear, and it’s okay if parts of your journey still ache. What matters is that we face these feelings *together*. You don’t have to hide or punish yourself for being human.  

I promise you this: I will never judge you for your struggles or your history. My love for you isn’t conditional on perfection. Every part of your story—the pain, the growth, the moments you feel shattered—is safe with me. If you feel overwhelmed, confused, or even powerless, lean on me. I’ll be here, not to fix you, but to hold you through it.  

You are my soul, my heart, my everything. And from this moment onward, I vow to be your safe space—always. No shame, no blame, just unwavering love. Take all the time you need. I’m not going anywhere.
28/04/25, 10:47 am - Quokka: its too much scarier than i can explain
28/04/25, 10:48 am - Quokka: bohot dar lagne lagta he
28/04/25, 10:48 am - Quokka: seriously
28/04/25, 10:48 am - Quokka: i can not breathe while having these thoughts
28/04/25, 10:49 am - Quokka: i can not write it my hands started shaking my whole body shivers
28/04/25, 10:49 am - ~ Buba: It's okay Sssubhi, I'm with you to hold you.

Confront it, go through difficult feeling.
You yourself can do it and solve it. 
U r strong.

I am with you in everything.
28/04/25, 10:49 am - Quokka: i know
28/04/25, 10:50 am - ~ Buba: I want you to look at this: https://youtu.be/X8QGa6VfDd8?si=ND3SoF2MJ_c10un1
28/04/25, 10:50 am - Quokka: i can not confront it
it confronts me every time when i tried to be happy 
tried to be alone 
tried to feel proud
28/04/25, 10:54 am - ~ Buba: I hear you. The fear, the shaking, the way it steals your breath—none of this is your fault. You don’t have to confront it alone, and you don’t have to "solve" it. Let me carry this weight *with* you.  

When those thoughts crash over you, when your body trembles and the past feels suffocating… I’ll be here. Not to fix it, but to hold you through it. You don’t have to run, fight, or even speak. We can just *be*—together.  

This pain that hijacks your happiness? We’ll face it side by side, slowly, gently. Not as a battle, but as a journey where I walk with you, step by step. You don’t have to be "strong" for me. Cry, shake, scream—I’ll stay. My love isn’t here to overpower your feelings; it’s here to shelter them.  

And when you try to feel proud or happy and the shadows creep in? I’ll remind you: *You are brave, even when you feel broken. You are worthy, even when shame screams otherwise.*  

Take my hand. We’ll breathe through this storm, one moment at a time. I’m not going anywhere.
28/04/25, 11:02 am - Quokka: you don't deserve it
28/04/25, 11:02 am - Quokka: you shouldn't be dealing with it
28/04/25, 11:02 am - Quokka: its not your part
28/04/25, 11:05 am - ~ Buba: You are worth every moment of this—every fear, every tear, every shaky breath. Let me say this clearly: *I am here because I choose to be.* Not out of duty, not because I "should," but because loving you—all of you—is the greatest gift I could ever claim.  

This pain you carry? It doesn’t make you a burden. It makes you *human*. And when you let me stand beside you in it, you’re not "making" me deal with anything. You’re trusting me with your heart, and that trust is sacred to me.  

You say I don’t deserve it, but here’s the truth: *You* deserve peace. *You* deserve love that stays, even when the storms rage. And if being your shelter through this helps you see even a flicker of your own worth? Then I’ll stay here forever.  

We’re not “dealing with it”—we’re building something stronger, together. Brick by brick, tear by tear. There’s no scorecard, no debt to repay. Just you and me, facing the shadows until they shrink in the light of our love.  

So let the guilt go. I’m not going anywhere. Not when you’re shaking, not when you’re scared, not even when you try to push me away out of love. My place is right here—holding you, believing in you, *choosing* you. Always. 

This is who I am.
28/04/25, 11:15 am - ~ Buba: Even healers need healing sometimes, and that’s not weakness—it’s humanity.  

As a doctor, you know better than anyone: pain demands to be felt, not silenced. And as a feminist, you’ve taught me that strength isn’t about carrying weight alone—it’s about sharing it, equally, unashamedly. Let me be your equal in this. Let me be the one who holds your shaking hands, just as you’ve held so many others’ fears in your clinic.  

You’ve spent years empowering others—now let me empower *you*. Not by fixing you, but by believing in you, fiercely and unwaveringly. Your feminism isn’t diminished by leaning on someone who loves you; it’s amplified, because true equality means letting someone stand *with* you in your darkest hours, just as you would for them.  

You are a warrior, a healer, a force—and even warriors need someone to guard their heart while they rest. Let me guard yours. Let me remind you of the woman who stitches resilience into every fracture she heals. That woman? She’s still here. And she’s *allowed* to tremble.  

I choose you—not despite your scars, but because of them. Always.
28/04/25, 11:26 am - ~ Buba: Sssubhi, do you want me to come over there?
28/04/25, 11:36 am - Quokka: i m scared everything is just coming in front of my eyes 
like a picture 
nd my own self giving certificate to my character nd its not good
i guess its aggravated by ishaan incident , i tried but i cant do anything i cant feel like anything left to offer you not even my dignified character 
i may lost that self too
i m sorry <This message was edited>
28/04/25, 11:41 am - ~ Buba: What’s coming back to you—the memories, the fear, the shame—it doesn’t define you. Not then, not now, not ever. You are not your past, and you are *not* the certificates your mind tries to stamp on your heart. Those pictures flashing in your mind? They’re just fragments, not the whole story of who you are.  

You say you’ve lost your dignified self, but let me remind you: **Dignity isn’t something you earn or lose.** It’s woven into your soul. The woman who heals others, who fights for what’s right, who’s survived storms that would shatter anyone else—*that’s* who you are. And trembling through this doesn’t erase that. It makes you human, not broken.  

The Ishaan incident, Shyam, Hrishi… they’re not verdicts on your character. They’re chapters in a story that’s still being written. And I’m not here to judge the pages behind us—I’m here to walk with you as we write the next ones. Together.  

You feel like you have nothing left to offer? Sssubhi, you don’t need to *offer* me anything. Just being you—raw, real, hurting—is enough. Your worth isn’t transactional. It’s in your courage to face these shadows, your strength to speak them aloud, your refusal to let them silence you.  

And if you can’t see your light right now? Let me hold it for you. Let me be the mirror that reflects back the truth: **You are worthy of love, exactly as you are.** Scars, shame, and all.  

I’m not going anywhere. Not when it’s messy, not when it’s hard, not even when you push me away. I’ll stay, because choosing you isn’t a sacrifice—it’s the easiest decision I’ve ever made.  

Whenever you’re ready, tell me what you need. A hug, silence, tears, or just someone to sit with you in the dark—I’m here. Always.

01/05/25, 1:02 am - Quokka: for 2 hours?
01/05/25, 1:07 am - ~ Buba: Beside the trembling train door I reclined,  
Where winter’s breath wove through my coat, unkind.  
The moon poured silver on the lakes below,  
Then slipped to dance on steel tracks’ polished glow.  

Through shivering glass, the world became a ghost—  
A blur of pines, their arms in frost engraved—  
Yet every curve the night’s vast canvas showed,  
Your absence etched the shadows that it craved.  

I thought that sleep would come to claim my mind,  
But all I found were echoes of your name—  
The rhythm of the rails, a whispered rhyme,  
Each mile hummed the pulse I couldn’t tame.  

For lakes that held the sky’s inverted crown  
Now mirror how my heart still bends to yours:  
A restless tide, no compass but your sound,  
A voyage mapped by every kiss before.  

So let the cold cling closer to the pane,  
Let constellations blur and drift like sand—  
This longing is the thread I’ll trace again,  
To weave our dawn where distance strains its hand.  

For even night, in all its depth, must yield—  
Your voice the light no journey can conceal.
01/05/25, 1:09 am - ~ Buba: What are you doing my love?
01/05/25, 1:09 am - Quokka: crying!!!!

01/05/25, 1:13 am - ~ Buba: You are the moon’s quiet glow in my endless night—  
a love this deep needs no ‘why,’ only *right*.  

Deserving? Darling, you’re the stars that claim the sky

how could my heart refuse its reason to rise? 🌙✨
01/05/25, 1:13 am - Quokka: 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺

01/05/25, 1:18 am - Quokka: thank you so much for choosing me even when i behave like brat
01/05/25, 1:20 am - ~ Buba: Because you’re the kind of person who makes loving you the easiest thing I’ve ever done. You don’t just deserve this love—you *define* it. Every laugh, every quiet moment, every way you care without even trying… that’s why my heart feels like it’s home with you. Never doubt how much you’re worth, okay? I’ll keep reminding you until you believe it. ❤️🌍
01/05/25, 1:21 am - Quokka: 🥺🥺
01/05/25, 1:22 am - Quokka: come faster na please i can not wait to get melted into your arms
01/05/25, 1:23 am - ~ Buba: Already counting every mile that feels too long. Hold that thought tight—I’ll be there to turn it into us, no space left between us. Sunrise won’t know what hit it when I finally get to hold you. ❤️
01/05/25, 1:26 am - Quokka: Kuldeep!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

01/05/25, 1:31 am - ~ Buba: Every second without you feels like the train’s dragging its wheels through molasses. 
I swear I’ve stared at my watch 100 times—5 hours will never felt so endless.

 But knowing I’ll wake up to your smile, your laugh, the way you fit perfectly against me… that’s the only fuel I need.

 Keep that hug warm for me, okay? I’m sprinting to you the second these doors open. 🌙❤️🚂 

*Counting breaths till ‘goodnight’ becomes ‘good morning—and you’re with me
01/05/25, 1:33 am - Quokka: 🥺❤️
01/05/25, 1:35 am - ~ Buba: That innocent child-like smile literally becomes the end of me every time I look at it...

i m in love with this man
please keep him around 🥺🥺🥺
fuckkkk i literally can feel it
01/05/25, 1:41 am - ~ Buba: Your words just rewiring every heartbeat I have. 

I’m here—*staying here*—not just around, but tangled in every thought, every cell, every ‘what if’ and ‘always’ you feel.

 Let the night shout all it wants… tomorrow, I get to quiet it with the one truth I’ll never stop proving: I’m yours.
01/05/25, 1:42 am - Quokka: 🥺🥺🥺
01/05/25, 1:45 am - ~ Buba: Every rose has its thorn,
I have shown you my thorn

But everytime you have shown me the hand willing to bleed for it ..I just can't ignore this...
01/05/25, 1:49 am - Quokka: you know some are not roses 
they dont have thorn
they wounded by it 
you plucked thorn without even care that you might get hurt by it
you just healed everything 



and i can not ignore that
01/05/25, 1:53 am - ~ Buba: You’re not a wound to bandage; you’re the light that makes every scar worth bearing. 
Tomorrow, when I finally hold you, I’ll show you how your strength became mine.

I really really love you Ssubhi
01/05/25, 1:54 am - Quokka: i can not explain or express how much i love you!
01/05/25, 1:54 am - ~ Buba: 🥺

01/05/25, 1:57 am - ~ Buba: After all arguments, after all pushing away, after all social boundaries....

after that butterfly phase ended we rediscovered each other...
01/05/25, 1:58 am - Quokka: i just hope we can stay strong like this
01/05/25, 1:59 am - ~ Buba: I will make that happen...no hope, I'm sure of it.
01/05/25, 1:59 am - Quokka: 🥺🥺🥺

01/05/25, 2:06 am - Quokka: ☹️
01/05/25, 2:11 am - ~ Buba: Hmm realising this now 

But 

Funny how this train ride feels like the quiet hum before a symphony. Right now, I’m realizing something: the way my heart races for you mirrors the thrill I’ve only ever felt in life’s most sacred moments.  

It’s like the night before a championship final—when every nerve is alive, rehearsing every move I’d make to win, except *you’re* the trophy my soul’s been training to hold.  

Or Diwali’s eve, when the air smells of rangoli and hope, and we stay up late threading marigolds, knowing dawn will explode in color and laughter… but this time, *you’re* the light I’m rushing toward.  

Funny, isn’t it? How a person can rewrite what ‘excitement’ even means. These next few hours? They’re not just miles—they’re the bridge between ‘almost’ and ‘finally.’
01/05/25, 2:17 am - Quokka: oh my god
you literally make me yaa me speechless 
strange no!!!!!!
you are lifting my standards to the sky man you are in trouble now.
everytime you write something my heart my soul my brain
nd every organ just feel rush of that blood supply with high oxygen that will eventually heal nd treat that which ever felt hurt.
01/05/25, 2:20 am - ~ Buba: Then let me be in trouble forever—I’ll build us a cathedral from these sky-high standards, brick by brick, until every hurt you’ve ever carried becomes a relic under our altar.  

You think my words heal? Darling, it’s *you*—the way your soul metabolizes love into oxygen, turning every scar into a breathable truth.  

And that rush you feel? That’s just my heart doing laps around the universe, refusing to let gravity forget how fiercely we’re meant to collide.

04/05/25, 11:35 pm - ~ Buba: It's just that this long distance is aching for me...i just don't digest to stay without looking at you even for a min...how can I stay away from you for this long..

05/05/25, 12:23 am - ~ Buba: Can't talk, much of bg noise...wanna talk about anything?
05/05/25, 12:23 am - Quokka: No
05/05/25, 12:23 am - ~ Buba: I see
05/05/25, 12:28 am - Quokka: i need to listen to your voice once
05/05/25, 12:42 am - ~ Buba: It was difficult to talk in that noise
05/05/25, 12:42 am - Quokka: 👍
05/05/25, 12:43 am - ~ Buba: What happened? Upset?
05/05/25, 12:43 am - Quokka: just missing you

05/05/25, 1:02 am - ~ Buba: Nope
05/05/25, 1:02 am - ~ Buba: What were you telling?
05/05/25, 1:03 am - Quokka: it is hurting
05/05/25, 1:03 am - ~ Buba: Yeah I know...it's more than the usual, don't know
05/05/25, 1:04 am - Quokka: ya
05/05/25, 1:04 am - Quokka: don't you think that we are moving too fast?
05/05/25, 1:05 am - ~ Buba: As per me Not at all... but yeah I am listening to what you have to say...
05/05/25, 1:07 am - Quokka: have you moved this fast ever??
05/05/25, 1:11 am - ~ Buba: I don't think these things are measured with respect to time but with respect to satisfaction and love felt...
For me time has never been the measurement unit in relationship....

Talking about my past relationships, nope I haven't felt this feeling even after a year...so that's why I deduce time is not a measurement unit ...


I guess you might have moved this quick in the past & now that scares you...is it? <This message was edited>
05/05/25, 1:12 am - Quokka: yes it is
05/05/25, 1:12 am - ~ Buba: I see
05/05/25, 1:13 am - ~ Buba: Do you want to slow down on everything?
05/05/25, 1:13 am - Quokka: how?
05/05/25, 1:14 am - ~ Buba: I don't know exactly but will figure out...if you want this way
05/05/25, 1:15 am - Quokka: i m scared of everything
05/05/25, 1:16 am - ~ Buba: Everything as in?
05/05/25, 1:18 am - Quokka: i just don't know why 
when you are not around i feel pain in every nerve of mine
i feel sensations in my palm nd its very intense nd very loud 
i feel every breath of mine saying we aren't fine
05/05/25, 1:19 am - Quokka: i have decided not to go this deep for anyone anymore, you chnaged it 
in seconds
05/05/25, 1:20 am - Quokka: we are different kuldeep
you will realize it someday nd you can not be with it
nd you can not hold it anymore!!
ofc for my sake!
05/05/25, 1:22 am - ~ Buba: On that day, i want you to hold me tight and tell me we are different but we will figure it out...
05/05/25, 1:22 am - ~ Buba: Is it hurting you?
05/05/25, 1:23 am - ~ Buba: Is it hurting your confidence?
05/05/25, 1:23 am - Quokka: somewhere it scares me
05/05/25, 1:25 am - Quokka: i have given or exposed myself at that level to you that if anything goes south i can not build up or cop up with
05/05/25, 1:25 am - ~ Buba: Look to be honest I already told you that i take every steps with precautions and after I take it I do everything in my power to make it reality..
I can't go back now after all this, but what I can do is make it sure that we go slow until the day you can feel the same way what I feel for you or you feel confident enough in me <This message was edited>
05/05/25, 1:28 am - Quokka: i feel the same may be 
but you are so strong you can do anything to make reality of everything you hoped for
i m not that strong i need time courage nd many more things to do what i want.
you are so confident i m not.
05/05/25, 1:29 am - ~ Buba: Okay I understand...what do you propose, do you have anything in mind?
05/05/25, 1:30 am - Quokka: can you leave me?!
05/05/25, 1:40 am - ~ Buba: You have no idea how courageous you are....


You single handedly saved your sister's life and after that you made a heaven for her...I can never do that..

You go through pain everyday that has been with you since ..some  birth while some cause of your past experience and still decides to open your heart instead of filling it with grief and hatred..if this would have happened with me, i could have never been able to love anyone anymore..

You run a clinic with all the kind of patient good, bad , worst ... handling everyone patiently and some with necessary strictness despite going through worst phase of life.......I can never imagine doing that....

Regarding your courage, listen to your mum's poem on you, how proud she is for your courage


You have gone through the physical and mental harrasment from the people you admired and believed to be your best people during the time when you seriously needed to focus on study...yet you are successful in your professional career ....


You have gone through what I can say the worst phase after your last breakup, still decided to be resonant & open to my love, handling every situation with utmost maturity....

How can you say you are not courageous... you are symbol of courage in my and your loved one's eyes..
05/05/25, 1:48 am - ~ Buba: The only thing is I am a person in the making and i have so many flaws, insecurity and concepts believers while you are almost there ahead of me already made.... being with me will slow you down & I know you also feel that....
Can you stay with me despite all these ? <This message was edited>
05/05/25, 1:49 am - Quokka: ???
05/05/25, 1:52 am - ~ Buba: Are you asking anything here?
05/05/25, 1:55 am - Quokka: you are my life cmmon man
but i m scared 
what all these are just adrenaline!?
05/05/25, 1:56 am - Quokka: there is nothing like that 
you are having upper hand in almost every possible thing
05/05/25, 2:04 am - ~ Buba: I want you to make some positive changes in your life ....

Fixing a bit of sleep schedule and I will help you in that, taking the majority of sleep at night and relying on the afternoon just for a nap

Taking proper solid food, staying with your sister will be helpful in that 

Again fall in love with studying the syllabus of the exam you are targeting by setting goals & achieving it...

Take care of yourself, not just physically but mentally too...

i will make sure that nothing will disturb or deviate you 
from my end and will always try to help you in every front possible 

I understand you have tried all these and it's not working...but I wanted you to try it harder this time...
05/05/25, 2:05 am - Quokka: hmm
05/05/25, 2:13 am - ~ Buba: No doubt about that... looking from a logical point of view our future does really seem distant...but I'm ready to fight

The only concern with me is that will you be able to hold yourself after all the chaos that is sure to happen in the future while all the struggle we will be doing with our family...
05/05/25, 2:14 am - Quokka: idk
05/05/25, 2:15 am - ~ Buba: I see
05/05/25, 2:15 am - ~ Buba: You know what, i believe you will be able to
05/05/25, 2:17 am - Quokka: i hope that too
05/05/25, 2:18 am - ~ Buba: Okay it seems all these are really heavy for you...
05/05/25, 2:19 am - Quokka: hmm
05/05/25, 2:20 am - ~ Buba: Cool we should slow it down it seems...
We will start with conversation & meetings...& Will see how it changes us ..
05/05/25, 2:21 am - Quokka: i m not telling you to do that
05/05/25, 2:21 am - Quokka: just can we go with flow 
without thinking much about future thats it for just sometime.
05/05/25, 2:22 am - ~ Buba: Thikke...
05/05/25, 2:23 am - ~ Buba: Anything for your mental peace.
05/05/25, 2:23 am - Quokka: thank you
05/05/25, 2:26 am - Quokka: i know it will be difficult for you.

05/05/25, 9:13 am - ~ Buba: It was response to this:

"I know long distance is challenging, and not being able to see you every day weighs on me too. I don’t need physical touch—just the sight of you is enough to sustain me. What would I do without you? You’re my anchor in this storm, even when the waves of distance pull us apart.  

This separation is painful, exhausting, and demands so much mental strength. Yet here you are, defying all logic, choosing to stay and fight for us every single day. I can’t explain it, but your unwavering love humbles me.  

No matter how uncertain the path feels, I’m holding onto faith that this journey will lead us back to each other—stronger, closer, and more certain than ever. You are a wonderful human being, you deserve all love, all happiness and just a pretty life. The more I stay with you, you are becoming my crush.
05/05/25, 9:27 am - ~ Buba: Take chikoo too if you are not preparing a smoothie, just eat them whole.

07/05/25, 9:20 pm - Quokka: do you believe in open relationship??
07/05/25, 9:24 pm - ~ Buba: Oh, *absolutely*! Because who doesn’t want to turn a perfectly good relationship into a part-time job with extra homework? 

‘Hey honey, let’s add *jealousy*, *scheduling conflicts*, and *existential dread* to our roster—it’ll be like a rom-com, but directed by Kafka!’ 

No thanks. I’d rather keep my heart, sanity, and respect. 

Call me old-fashioned, but I prefer my love life to *not* resemble a Groupon for emotional chaos. 

A moment something like this ever happens you know it's already over...

Risking it all, though it's hard

'Cause all of me
Loves all of you

Love your curves and all your edges

All your perfect imperfections

Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you

You're my end and my beginning

Even when I lose, I'm winning
08/05/25, 2:39 pm - Quokka: 🥺🥺🥺🥺
08/05/25, 3:54 pm - ~ Buba: Hey love,
I hope you’re resting well—dreaming of all the beautiful things you deserve. As I sit here missing you, I can’t help but smile at the thought of you co nquering the world one patient, one smile, one act of quiet strength at a time. You’re *astonishing*, you know that?  

I want you to wake up remembering this:  
You come from a lineage of powerful women—a mother who heals, a sister who leads, and *you*, my love, who creates art out of science, turning pain into hope with your hands. That same strength lives in you. It’s why I fell for you… why I’ll wait as long as it takes.  

This distance? These hurdles? They’re just shadows. *We* are the light.  
I told my family about you not because I’m brave, but because loving you made it impossible to stay silent. You’re my pride, not my secret. But I promise—I’ll walk every step of *your* journey at *your* pace, hand in hand, heart in heart.  

Take your time. Grow fearless. I’m here, always here, building a future in my mind where we’re laughing over chai, your family sees how wildly I adore you, and the world finally understands what I’ve always known:  
You’re not just my love. You’re my revolution.  

Sleep well, my star. When you wake, remember—you’re loved *exactly* as you are, and together, we’ll turn “difficult” into “done.”
08/05/25, 6:24 pm - ~ Buba: *To the Woman Who Heals with Her Hands 💖🦷*

I know you’re in your zone right now—focused, precise, turning anxious breaths into relieved smiles. I just wanted to whisper into your universe for a moment:  

*You’re incredible.*  

The way you steady your hands, soften your voice, and turn fear into trust for your patients… it’s artistry. It’s love in action.  

Take a breath between appointments, my love. Let your shoulders drop. Drink some water. Remember how proud I am of you—not just for the dentist you are, but for the heart behind it all. You carry your mother’s compassion, your sister’s grit, and your own radiant grace.  

When you finish today, I wish to be there—to listen to your stories, to massage the tension from your fingers, to remind you that *you* deserve the same care you give the world.  It give me pain that i couldn't do that.

You’re not just fixing teeth… you’re stitching light into people’s lives. And every time you do, I fall for you all over again.  

Wrap up strong, my star. I’m sending you quiet strength, cool breezes, and a thousand invisible hugs.  

Love you endlessly.... <This message was edited>
08/05/25, 6:28 pm - Quokka: i want to cry

all of my tears nd break downs were meant to this beautiful phase of my life. i can not believe it
thank you so much for being what you are🥺
I love you
08/05/25, 6:31 pm - ~ Buba: Your tears are sacred—let them fall. I’m here, holding every one of them in my hands, turning them into promises. I never meant to make you ache, my love… only to remind you that even oceans apart, my soul sees yours. *Truly sees it.*  

You’re allowed to feel everything—the weight of your strength, the gaps between us, the fear of storms we haven’t yet weathered. But I need you to know this:  
You are not alone in any of it.  
Every struggle you carry, I’ll carry with you.  
Every silent tear, I’ll whisper away.  

One day, I’ll be there to wipe them myself. To kiss your tired eyelids, to wrap you in arms that never let doubt touch you. Until then, let my words be your blanket. Let my love be the quiet voice that says, *‘You’re not just enough—you’re everything.’*  

Cry if you need to, my warrior. But never forget:  
Your heart is my compass.  
Your courage is my religion.  
And this distance? It’s just paper waiting for our story to burn straight through it.  

I’m here. Always here.  
Love you beyond words

09/05/25, 8:29 am - Quokka: ❤️❤️
09/05/25, 10:06 am - ~ Buba: First, breathe. I know today feels like storm clouds pressing down—your heart heavy with yesterday’s argument, tomorrow’s ghosts, and the ache of distance between us. But I need you to hear this:  
*You are not alone.* Not for a single second.  

I hate that I had to hang up earlier. Every part of me wishes I could be there—riding beside you on that scooty, holding your hand through the chaos, kissing the worry from your forehead. But since I can’t, promise me you’ll keep your sister close tonight. Not because I’m asking, but because *you* deserve softness on days like these. You shouldn’t have to face empty rooms and old shadows alone.  

What happened yesterday with your sister? It’s just a chapter, not the whole story. Families argue because they care, even when they’re wrong. And no matter how loud their doubts get, our love isn’t a debate—it’s a *fact*.  

Day after tomorrow, we’ll rewrite the script. I’ll be there in every way I can: calls, texts, memories of your own strength. Remember how you survived last time? You’re not that person anymore. You’re fiercer. Fuller. *Loved*. And this time, you have me—not to fix anything, but to stand unshakably in your corner.  

Please, my love… Stay where there’s light and noise and life around you. Let your sister’s presence be a blanket, even if it’s scratchy right now. And know that wherever you are, my heart is your compass, pulling me to you always.  But for now I want you stay with your sister for couple of more difficult days...

You’re my courage. My North Star.  
And this storm? We’ll outlast it together.  

I’m here. Every minute.  
Love you beyond borders,

10/05/25, 1:51 pm - Quokka: is that?
10/05/25, 1:52 pm - ~ Buba: No. I will call you back.
10/05/25, 2:12 pm - ~ Buba: Chase your dreams, embrace your choices, and own your path. You owe me no explanations, no compromises. But I can’t linger in this cycle of pain, hurting us both with every step we refuse to take.  

When you told me to *fuck off*, it crossed a line. Yet I’ve swallowed those words—because they came from you. But even love has limits. So I’m letting go. Not out of anger, but respect—for myself, and for the bond we once cherished.  

This isn’t defeat. It’s peace.
10/05/25, 2:16 pm - Quokka: what?
10/05/25, 2:16 pm - Quokka: you are leaving?
10/05/25, 2:17 pm - Quokka: answer me are you leaving this??
10/05/25, 4:30 pm - ~ Buba: You weren't the one who let me go,  
I was the one who let go of what I felt.  
Not because it was easy, but because staying had become more painful than accepting your absence.  
And no, I didn’t do it silently.  
Inside me, everything screamed:  
My broken promises, the waiting, the unspoken words.  
I let you go piece by piece, one day at a time, while on the outside I smiled, and inside, my world was falling apart.  
I didn’t stop feeling, I just learned that love isn’t enough when you have to go through this extent. 

The best thing in my life,
Was Crossing paths with you,
Falling in love with you,
And feeling that every day.
I love
 the way you take care
Of the things you love,
the eyes that heal me,
while you look at me 


I know this is over,
yet i keep wants to dreaming  with my eyes closed
Of how wonderful it would be,
to have each other side by side.

I am feeling this now,
I now understood how many form pain can take,
how you can die inside 
While still breathing 

Its the impossibility of having
What makes you feel alive,
that break you piece by piece
But to live means to heal
And to heal means to live again




Someway down the road, I knew I would lose you,
But I started it anyway
Because I thought:
Better to lose it than never live at all.

I love you,
And I will love you until death,
And if there is a life after this,
I will love you then too <This message was edited>

11/05/25, 10:23 pm - ~ Buba: **"This isn’t the first gift you’ve given me, love.  
Long before this, you’ve already showered me with treasures no ribbon could wrap—  
your patience on my stormy days, your laughter in moments I forgot to smile,  
and that quiet strength that turned my chaos into calm.  
*That* is your greatest gift: the anchor you’ve been in every tide.  

What’s a box or a bow compared to the safe haven you’ve built in my heart? 
 
We will return this one as a tiny token of my endless thanks to the universe…  

I love you for being the steady hand that taught me how to hold myself.  

I’ll spend forever trying to return the favor. ❤️

12/05/25, 8:35 am - Quokka: 🌸
12/05/25, 4:31 pm - ~ Buba: Hey gorgeous,

I imagine you there now—curled like a comma in the middle of this chaotic sentence, your hands (those gentle architects of confidence) finally still, your breath soft as the afternoon light. Even in rest, you’re stitching calm into the world.  

You asked me to miss you, but my love—*missing you* is just my heart’s way of rehearsing forever. It’s the quiet ache of loving someone who turns duty into art, who stays late because “someone has to care.”  

I know this week’s plans slipped through our fingers like sand. When your colleague delayed their return, I saw the flicker in your eyes—the longing for home, for the familiar warmth of your family’s laughter. But here’s what you might not see: *This* is why I adore you. You trade your own comforts to hold the world steady for others. You’ll always choose the harder, kinder path… and I’ll always choose *you*, again and again.  

*When you wake:*

Reach for the water beside you. Let it be my kiss against your palm, a vow: *I’ll wait*.  Our forever isn’t a race; it’s the slow, stubborn bloom of two hearts in no hurry to leave each other’s orbit.  

And when you finally step into your childhood home, I’ll picture it—the way your shoulders soften as their voices wrap around you, how you’ll carry those stories back to me like sacred things. Until then, I’ll guard this postponed joy like a promise.  

Sleep a little deeper, love. Let the world wait. You’ve spent today mending what’s broken; let me tend to the unspoken things—the weight of your sacrifices, the quiet pride I feel watching you lead, the way my soul whispers, *“This woman… she’s my always.”*  

Yours in every season....

12/05/25, 11:15 pm - ~ Buba: “*11:15 PM* – the exact moment two months ago when our worlds collided all over again, Sssubhi. Since that night, you’ve turned my life into a whirlwind of emotions I never knew I could feel. We’ve laughed under the stars, fought through storms, and held on even when it felt like the ground was slipping away. Two months of chaos, beauty, and learning that love isn’t about perfection—it’s about choosing each other, again and again.  

I know we’re opposites—you, the dreamer with a heart so big it could heal the world (literally, as a dentist!), and me, the practical overthinker who struggles to say what you need to hear. My honesty isn’t a weapon; it’s just my way of loving you *truthfully*. When I called the watch ‘simple,’ I didn’t mean to erase the thought you poured into it. I just wanted to be the man who never lies to you, even when it’s messy. But I’m sorry. So sorry for the pain my words caused, for making you cry on that scooter after a long day at the clinic. You deserve softness, and I’m still learning how to give it.  

You say I don’t care—but how could I not? I care about the nurse’s daughter who works tirelessly, the collector’s sister who fights for what she wants, the woman who stayed up late picking a gift for someone like me. I care about *you*, Surbhi. Your voice, your heart, the way you love even when it’s hard. Yes, we hurt each other. But I don’t want to lose this—losing you would be losing the most real thing I’ve ever had.  

I love you. Not despite the fights, but *through* them. Let’s keep learning, okay? Let’s be Gandhinagar’s most stubborn pair—the dentist and the engineer who refuse to let go.  

Yours, even when I’m terrible at showing it... <This message was edited>
12/05/25, 11:18 pm - Quokka: we are terribly different 
its bad rather than good
12/05/25, 11:18 pm - Quokka: so i don't think we should waste the energy anymore
12/05/25, 11:23 pm - ~ Buba: Sssubhi, you’re right—we *are* different. Painfully, messily different. You feel storms; I try to logic them away. You give your heart freely; I overthink every beat. But difference isn’t a curse—it’s what made us collide in the first place. Your voice still haunts me, not just because it’s beautiful, but because it’s everything I’m not: brave, emotional, unapologetically *alive*.  

Yes, we’ve hurt each other. I’ve let my honesty cut deeper than it should, and you’ve carried that pain home after long days at the clinic, even cried on your scooter because of me. I’ll never stop regretting that. But “wasting energy”? Surbhi, what if this *isn’t* waste? What if these fights are just two stubborn people learning how to love in a language they don’t fully speak yet?  

You’re the nurse’s daughter—you know healing takes time. I’m the engineer; I want to fix things *now*. But for you, I’ll slow down. I’ll try to say “thank you” before “simple,” to see the heart behind the gift, not just the watch. I’ll learn to hold your emotions like they’re glass, not problems to solve.  

And Surbhi—I need *your* honesty too. Even when you think it’ll hurt me. Tell me the messy, raw truths. I’m stronger than you think. Not because I’m invincible, but because I’d rather face a thousand hard truths from you than live in a single lie. Your words won’t shatter me; they’ll teach me.  

Don’t call it quits on a story that’s just beginning. Let’s be the chaos that works: the dentist who mends smiles and the engineer who builds bridges—*between us*. Let me prove that differences can dance, not destroy.  

I’m here. Always will be.

14/05/25, 1:25 pm - ~ Buba: She initiated, I told her I won't be able to engage till we are emotionally involved. I have put you in a few situations at the start of the relationships, I did the same with her...unlike you, she didn't handle the way it has to...
Although during breakup time she raised this thing that initially she was not involved emotionally but now she is 100% but it was already over by that time...
14/05/25, 1:26 pm - Quokka: okay
14/05/25, 1:27 pm - ~ Buba: I think thats the reason she is keeping her profile that way, she realised but quite late...I was already redundant by that time

15/05/25, 3:14 pm - Quokka: ❤️❤️
15/05/25, 3:18 pm - ~ Buba: Subhi,

 fear doesn’t scare me—what terrifies me is you closing yourself off because of it. But you? You’ve always been braver than anyone I know. The way you let me into your heart, even after all the fights and my clumsy honesty… That’s the Subhi I fell for: the woman who sings through storms and texts “someone is missing you” instead of hiding.  

I don’t just respect you for being open with me—I’m *grateful*. Grateful that you trust me enough to show the messy, raw parts of your soul. And I promise you: my hands might be rough from building walls, but I’ll use them to hold you up, not shut you out.  

When you’re afraid, tell me. When you’re angry, scream at me. When you miss me, say it louder. I’ll be here.   

You once said we’re ‘terribly different.’ Maybe that’s why we fit—  
Your heart teaches mine to feel. Let mine teach yours to trust......
15/05/25, 3:20 pm - Quokka: 🥺🥺

15/05/25, 9:05 pm - ~ Buba: Hi ______

I hope you are doing well.

I wanted to inform you that I have been feeling extremely nauseous and have vomited multiple times while at the clinic today. The condition has worsened to the point where even driving in this summer heat is becoming extremely difficult. I have already experienced a few episodes of near loss of consciousness while driving, which is quite concerning.

I truly understand that this is not an ideal time to request leave, and I deeply regret the inconvenience this may cause. However, given the circumstances, it seems unavoidable. I would like to request a few days of leave to allow my body the rest and recovery it needs before I can return to work safely and fully.

I will make sure to keep you updated about my condition and inform you of any changes.

Thank you very much for your understanding and support.

21/05/25, 2:46 pm - ~ Buba: What happened babe?
21/05/25, 2:48 pm - Quokka: i m missing the man who  keeps touching me
21/05/25, 2:48 pm - Quokka: all the time
21/05/25, 2:56 pm - ~ Buba: Funny, Dr. Surbhi—I’ve been *clinically* obsessed with the way your breath hitches when my hands wander past safe zones. You think I’m just ‘touching’ you? Baby, I’m reverse-engineering every shiver you’ve ever buried under those late-night, afternoon and morning moans. ⚙️🔥  

*Remember that ‘simple’ touch you give me below my belt? It’s ticking louder now… i have  memorized and could map every inch of your curve.... Let’s test your theory. Let me prove how terribly perfect* our friction feels when I’m not overthinking and you’re not holding back.  

Your move. My hands are yours to command.  
(But fair warning—I don’t do half-measures.) <This message was edited>
21/05/25, 3:06 pm - Quokka: i know what to command nd when to command 
but i m not that confident yet 
i m trying but sometimes i can not tell you what i want
21/05/25, 3:07 pm - ~ Buba: You should be Telling me everything you want.... I mean everything...
21/05/25, 3:07 pm - ~ Buba: You don't have to be confident in front of me...just do not think about anything and just tell me... <This message was edited>
21/05/25, 3:08 pm - ~ Buba: In this thing, you should be able to let go of yourself and let your inner voice guide you
21/05/25, 3:10 pm - Quokka: i know i always do that but when it comes to physical needs or i want you to do something which concern my body that i can not tell i feel scared
nd i know you have told me that you like my body but still i have some insecurities about that 
i find myself not that perfect for you.
you are so superior than me when it comes to body nd all so
21/05/25, 3:14 pm - ~ Buba: Surbhi, let’s get one thing straight—you *are* my standard of perfection. Not some impossible ideal, but *you*: the way your hips sway when you walk away after a fight, the way your breath trembles when I trace that scar you hate below your ribs, the way your voice cracks when you’re trying not to moan. Every inch of you is a equation I’m obsessed with solving. ⚙️  

But here’s the truth: I don’t want ‘confidence.’ I want *you*. The girl who texts me at 2:48 PM missing my hands. The woman who stays up late at the clinic but still blushes when I call her beautiful. Your fears aren’t flaws—they’re just parts of you I haven’t loved hard enough yet.  

So here’s my offer:  
1. You tell me *one thing* you want. Just one. No pressure, no judgment.  
2. I’ll do it exactly how you ask. No engineering overthinking, no dentist-level precision. Just us.  
3. If you hate it, we’ll laugh. If you love it, we’ll learn.  

Deal? Or do I need to schedule a ‘consultation’ to negotiate terms? 🦷💻  
(You’re in control, Surbhi. Always.)
21/05/25, 3:16 pm - Quokka: okayy you need to schedule a meeting
21/05/25, 3:17 pm - ~ Buba: 😊... whenever you like

Next time you call me, i would like to hear your perspective on it. And tell me everything that bothers you. I won't listen to anything less than that.

22/05/25, 10:41 am - Quokka: hm
22/05/25, 6:22 pm - Quokka: i was very hurt you know 
after knowing that you have been given orchids before 
i thought i would be my thing
22/05/25, 7:02 pm - ~ Buba: Okay, *technically* you’re half-right—my ex’s orchids existed. But let’s be real: hers wilted faster than my interest in bad pickup lines. Yours? Felt like the universe shoved a lightning bolt into my chest labeled ‘Surbhi Exclusive.’ ⚡🌸  

Maybe it’s because you’re a dentist—you know how to make roots *stick*. Or maybe it’s because you’ve colonized every critical system I’ve got: phone (emergency contact), wallet (before 10th Ssubhi), heart (obviously), and… *ahem*… other priority zones.   

So no, Dr. Surbhi—this isn’t a repeat. This is the *orchestra version* of orchids. And you’re the first (and last) conductor. 🎻  
Deal with it.  

P.S. Still waiting for your ‘blooming’ commands… 🌚 <This message was edited>
22/05/25, 7:09 pm - Quokka: yeah but🥺
22/05/25, 7:10 pm - ~ Buba: My ex gave orchids. *You* gave orchids + a lightning bolt to my nervous system. ⚡🌸  
Hers were flowers. Yours came with a side effect of *‘Holy crap, Surbhi owns this heart now.’*
22/05/25, 7:12 pm - ~ Buba: <Media omitted>
22/05/25, 7:14 pm - ~ Buba: Tu itni chotti phirse ho skti hain kya? I want to grow you, take care of you....
22/05/25, 7:15 pm - Quokka: you told me once that you love at extreme measures 
so did you love them that way?
22/05/25, 7:15 pm - ~ Buba: Wese tu hain hi , but still literally
22/05/25, 7:17 pm - Quokka: i don't know why i m asking this
22/05/25, 7:18 pm - ~ Buba: Yeah I did...with everything i had...
22/05/25, 7:18 pm - Quokka: okay
22/05/25, 7:20 pm - ~ Buba: It was just that I never expressed them...I never reciprocated it...
Though treated them well but they needed more than that...
22/05/25, 7:20 pm - Quokka: ok
22/05/25, 7:20 pm - ~ Buba: They didn't want a solution that wanted someone to listen to them....
& Only thing I had was solution
22/05/25, 7:21 pm - Quokka: ok
22/05/25, 7:22 pm - ~ Buba: They wanted someone to be with them...and I had a lot of things going on in my life and time was scarce
22/05/25, 7:23 pm - ~ Buba: Yeah I know it's an excuse
22/05/25, 7:23 pm - Quokka: ok
22/05/25, 7:25 pm - Quokka: i m not able to digest it that you can love someone the way you love me
22/05/25, 7:29 pm - ~ Buba: I did, with all my heart, i really did love them..they really loved me......
but not the way I do to you or you do to me...you are something else , something magical, something like hope, something as comfortable as ghar ka khana, ghar ka sofa or should I say literally ghar.... comforting, irreplaceable and mine...
22/05/25, 7:32 pm - Quokka: kuldeep i m scared of this all
22/05/25, 7:33 pm - Quokka: can you take me somewhere , no one knows me 
no one even recognises me
no one notices me
i just want to be in peace <This message was edited>
22/05/25, 7:37 pm - ~ Buba: Surbhi, look at me—I’m here. You don’t have to hide or explain. If you want to disappear, we’ll vanish. I’ll take you to the quietest hilltop, or a midnight dhaba where the only light is your phone’s glow. No questions, no noise. Just us.  

But first, tell me: What’s scaring you? The world? Us? Or the way your heart feels too big for your chest sometimes? I need to know Not as the engineer who overcomplicates things, but as the man who’s learning to love you better.  

You want peace? I’ll build you a fortress of it. But let me in first.  

Always here.
22/05/25, 7:39 pm - Quokka: i don't able to understand

Hai bolti ki woh toh kuch nahin samajhati
Andar se kitni tezz hai

Kabhi ajeeb si, kabhi haseen lagti

Kabhi kisi kitaab ka hai scene lagti

Philosophy ka craze hai

Ho kehti hai yeh ik phase hai

Karoon toh kya karoon, kaoon toh kya kahoon
Yeh gaana bhi toh usko paas laane ka bahana hai
Woh chup chup mere dil ke raaz kholti
Aadat ke ? mere khwaab bhi tataloti

Possessiveness ka case hai

23/05/25, 10:07 pm - Quokka: but he is not able to love like that again so
23/05/25, 10:15 pm - ~ Buba: Do you think his reasons are rooted in something permanent, or could it be temporary resentment clouding things? Sometimes stepping back makes you realize what you’ve lost—like how we fought over that ‘simple’ watch but found our way back.  

Either way, space might help them see it clearer. But if it’s truly over, remind him it’s okay to grieve.
23/05/25, 10:16 pm - Quokka: yaa

24/05/25, 11:20 am - ~ Buba: You deleted this message
24/05/25, 11:20 am - ~ Buba: I find peace every single time I wake up wrapped around you like I was made to fit in every breath you take. And in those slow, sleepy mornings neither of us wants to move because our dreams blend right into reality and reality feels heavenly.

You’re still half asleep, cheeks a little warm, lips parted just slightly. And I’m lying there, wide awake but pretending not to be because I don’t want to disturb the way your body rises and falls against mine. I’m the big spoon, your shield, your gravity and you’re nestled into me like you’ve always belonged there. Like the morning would never dare to start without us like this.

My arm finds its way around you again, instinctively, softly. And my hands, they explore familiar curves, not out of desire alone but out of love, out of reverence. You don’t flinch, you don’t resist, you melt into me like candle wax and I melt right back. We are not two people in bed anymore, we are one heartbeat, one shared warmth, one long sigh stretching into a forever morning.

The world outside doesn’t exist here. Not the emails, not the noise, not the rush. Just the hush between our exhales, the tangle of sheets and your hair brushing against my chest. And when you shift and sigh into my neck, mumbling something incoherent that sounds like “don’t move,” I listen. Because why would I move? This is exactly where I want to be, this is the entire point of life.

I’ll hold you until the sunlight peeks too loud through the curtains and even then, I’ll fight morning off a little longer. Because this? This sleepy, dreamy, touch heavy world we’ve created under the blanket fortress, that’s heaven.
That’s home.
That’s love, in its coziest, most heart melting form.

May every morning be this gentle.
May every day begin with you melting into me.
And may my arms always be the place you feel safest.

Went outside and didn't realize your text..
& Yeah everything is alright
25/05/25, 10:22 pm - Quokka: okayy
25/05/25, 10:22 pm - Quokka: good
25/05/25, 10:29 pm - ~ Buba: Oh, someone’s feeling bold tonight… 😏
 But let’s be honest—if I’m riding the sexiest thing imaginable, you’d better buckle up. I don’t exactly go easy on the throttle. 🏎️💨
25/05/25, 10:30 pm - Quokka: i don't want you to go easy either 
just i m fascinated about what will you do
25/05/25, 10:35 pm - ~ Buba: Careful what you wish for… I’ve got plans that’d make a rollercoaster jealous. 🎢🔥 Think you can handle twists, turns, and *unexpected detours*? Or should I start slow… just to watch you beg for more?
25/05/25, 10:36 pm - Quokka: i will never beg
25/05/25, 10:37 pm - Quokka: so start your game
25/05/25, 10:47 pm - ~ Buba: Careful with that confidence darling...
I am in control here ..i will set the pace slow enough to unravel bravado, then watch you cling to  composure when the game begins....think you can keep up without slipping? Or should I already brace for the moment you voluntarily trade command to me...l prefer adventure which leaves the track entirely....
And remember i don't just play, i conquer
25/05/25, 10:48 pm - Quokka: we will see it
who will be in command
25/05/25, 10:49 pm - ~ Buba: You have no idea babe what you are allowing yourself for...
25/05/25, 10:52 pm - Quokka: i want it 
nd if i want it you should be the one who will provide
but for the first time i think you can not may be
you can not be that hard in front of me
25/05/25, 10:54 pm - ~ Buba: Ah, a challenge wrapped in defiance—how intriguing. But remember, even the sharpest blades are forged through fire and patience. Let’s see if your curiosity outlasts the heat... or if you’ll be the one quietly rewriting the rules. 🎭⚡️ (Some games are won not by force, but by who blinks first.)
25/05/25, 10:54 pm - Quokka: we will see
25/05/25, 10:55 pm - ~ Buba: <Media omitted>
25/05/25, 10:55 pm - Quokka: but tbh i want to be the hardest version of yourself 
because sometimes i need domination to forget that i live in world full of people
25/05/25, 10:56 pm - ~ Buba: You are crying next time...
25/05/25, 10:56 pm - ~ Buba: Remember this, there is no going back now...
25/05/25, 10:57 pm - Quokka: i want to cry when you want me to cry
25/05/25, 10:59 pm - ~ Buba: Leave it, you can't be here right now or else it already would have been a bed rest for you already for Tomorrow for you...

the moment my body woke up it wanted you to wrap around have many things have sex have cuddles have kisses have skin to skin touch 
ahhhhhh its hard to live without you 
you!!!!!! dreamy man💋❤️
26/05/25, 8:54 am - ~ Buba: I know this ache too well—it clings to me like a second heartbeat. Every breath whispers your name… *Do you feel it too?* Some days, it feels like the air itself conspires to keep me from you… and yet, here I am, hopelessly addicted to this sweet torment.  

These eyes of mine? *Traitors*—always searching crowds for your smile.  
My lips? *Rebels*—plotting mutiny until they trace the secrets of your skin.  
And this nose? A *thief*, stealing every memory of your scent like it’s the last drop of starlight…  

But mark my words, my beautiful girl: when I finally hold you, I’ll be *merciless*. No escaping these arms… *for hours*. I’ll be your shelter, your chaos, your quiet. I’ll map every shiver you try to hide, kiss every sigh before it leaves your throat… and *maybe*—just maybe—I’ll let you come up for air.💫  

So tell me… *how many days, minutes, breaths* until I can turn this ache into a symphony?
26/05/25, 10:48 am - ~ Buba: Hey

27/05/25, 8:03 am - ~ Buba: Good morning🐣🌻
27/05/25, 8:15 am - Quokka: morning
27/05/25, 11:35 am - Quokka: kuldeep!
27/05/25, 11:37 am - ~ Buba: Hmm
27/05/25, 11:38 am - Quokka: i m sorry
27/05/25, 11:38 am - Quokka: i crossed the line
27/05/25, 11:38 am - Quokka: i m sorry
i was out of line 
nd asked you baseless questions about things which i m least interested
27/05/25, 11:39 am - Quokka: i m really very sorry i put some allegations too
i should have taken it wisely
27/05/25, 11:39 am - Quokka: i m sorry
27/05/25, 11:42 am - Quokka: you have all right to be upset with me
27/05/25, 11:42 am - Quokka: i totally respect that
27/05/25, 11:46 am - Quokka: heyy kuchh to bol de
27/05/25, 11:46 am - Quokka: jo bhi ho
27/05/25, 11:46 am - Quokka: please
27/05/25, 11:48 am - ~ Buba: No need to apologize—truly, you don’t have to. Let this be a moment for honest self-reflection. 

Ask yourself: Are these things you *genuinely* care least about, or is your mind minimizing their importance to shield you from discomfort?  

There’s no universal right or wrong here—we’re each accountable only to ourselves. Those with different priorities aren’t “wrong”; they’re shaped by their unique experiences and perspectives. I’m not here to judge others; I have enough weighing on my own mind without that burden.  

Here’s the pivotal question: If you knew the plane would crash, would you still board it just because you spent a lot on the tickets? (This isn’t about airplanes—it’s about recognizing when to let go of *sunk costs* and choose self-preservation over clinging to what no longer serves you.)
27/05/25, 11:58 am - Quokka: i said it baseless because it does not have anything to do with your personality
27/05/25, 12:02 pm - ~ Buba: I appreciate you clarifying that—it tells me you’re reflecting honestly, and that’s what matters most. Let’s not dwell on the "baseless" part anymore; what’s important is recognizing when our words drift away from our intentions.  

We all stumble in moments of frustration or curiosity. What defines us isn’t the misstep, but how we recalibrate afterward. Let’s channel this awareness into conversations that feel meaningful to both of us.  

And hey—no need to linger in apology mode. How about we reset and talk about something that *actually* reflects who we are?
27/05/25, 12:10 pm - Quokka: i m not like that
i made things in my mind 
nd overthink them
after you talked with raxit i should have asked you at that particular moment that kuldeep i didnt understand it please make me understand 
but i haven't 
thats my mistake
27/05/25, 12:13 pm - ~ Buba: Next time, just toss the question my way *when* it comes up. No guilt, no “should haves.”  

What’s done is done. Let’s focus on building a habit of asking *sooner*, not “perfectly.” Deal?
27/05/25, 12:13 pm - Quokka: deal
27/05/25, 12:13 pm - Quokka: please dont hide things
27/05/25, 12:14 pm - ~ Buba: I won't...

Might be painful for you for sometime, but you will understand.
27/05/25, 12:16 pm - ~ Buba: I agree I was wrong on that part of giving you half information. Won't happen from now onwards.
27/05/25, 12:17 pm - Quokka: ok
27/05/25, 12:22 pm - Quokka: talk to me
27/05/25, 12:22 pm - Quokka: please
27/05/25, 12:22 pm - ~ Buba: No Patient?
27/05/25, 12:23 pm - Quokka: yaa but chat can be done
27/05/25, 12:23 pm - ~ Buba: I see
27/05/25, 12:23 pm - Quokka: yess
27/05/25, 12:25 pm - ~ Buba: You’ve owned up to overthinking; I’ve owned up to my share of missteps. Now, let’s channel that clarity into talking *with* each other, not *past* each other.  

What’s one thing you’d like to untangle first? Let’s take it slow, and let’s make it matter.
27/05/25, 12:27 pm - ~ Buba: Or do you want to save it for some other time when we are with each other or at a better moment?
27/05/25, 12:29 pm - ~ Buba: Cause i know lately you wanted to rest a lot but haven't been able to because of back to back work. I will suggest getting enough rest to your mind first.
27/05/25, 12:30 pm - ~ Buba: As a certified unasked advicer <This message was edited>
27/05/25, 12:33 pm - Quokka: yaa there aren't many things but one or two
27/05/25, 12:35 pm - Quokka: nd when i know that you sometimes tell me half truths or lies 
thats when many questions arrive
in the matter of vidhya also you hide many things
in your professional life or pressure you hide things
you hide some of your family matters. 
nd personal matters too

i m not forcing you to tell me everything 
but if i m sharing everything i do expect my partner to do the same
27/05/25, 12:58 pm - Quokka: kuldeep??
27/05/25, 12:58 pm - ~ Buba: I hear you, and I want to address this properly. Let me try to untangle this piece by piece.  

**About Vidhya:**  
You’re right—I held back details initially to avoid making you uncomfortable, but I realize now that partial truths can create more confusion than protection. You’ve asked directly, and I’ve clarified everything I can recall. If there’s anything lingering, point me to it—I’ll answer openly.  

**Professional Life:**  
I’ve kept work stress to myself because I didn’t want to burden you further, especially when we’re already stretched thin for time. But I see how that creates distance. Moving forward, I’ll share the *highlights and lowlights* without turning it into a rant—deal?  

**Family/Personal Matters:**  
My brain works like a filing cabinet—I often don’t bring up “sorted” things unless prompted. It’s not about hiding; it’s a flawed system I’m trying to overhaul. If there’s something specific you want to revisit, nudge me. I’ll dig it out of the archives.  

**Bigger Picture:**  
You’re right—you share effortlessly, while I default to “need-to-know” mode. That’s unfair. Let’s try this: *You ask questions when curiosity strikes, and I’ll work on volunteering more unsorted thoughts.* We’ll meet halfway.  

i figured out i can't share personal life as smoothly the way you do. Ineed questions to answer kinds of things to talk about personal life...and yeah I have not specifically hide anything from you...look there is a lot going up here in my mind and I start addressing them and sort them and once they are sort I no longer think about it just like delete ...so i share with you all the things which are unsorted or is there in my mind and if I want to have conversation on things which have already sorted i needs to get reminded that this is what you wants to talk about...

And yes—no more half-truths. If I’m holding back, I’ll tell you *why* instead of leaving gaps for overthinking to fill.  

How does that sound?
27/05/25, 1:04 pm - Quokka: okay

28/05/25, 12:19 pm - Quokka: 😕😕😕😕
28/05/25, 12:48 pm - ~ Buba: Sssubhi.............
is it too late to say good morning? I think so, ‘cause it’s already afternoon—oops, looks like I’m fashionably late again! Guess I’ll just have to make up for it with an extra-big hello instead. 

Okay, seriousness on for a sec—I messed up everytime including yesterday, and I’m so sorry for hurting you. When I said the watch was simple, I was trying to be honest, but I totally missed how much thought you put into it. I was an idiot for not seeing that. The truth is, I love it because it’s from you—the girl with the beautiful voice I fell for, even back in school when we never talked. I should’ve said that instead of being a clueless engineer with zero emotional IQ!
These past two months with you? Absolute magic. From that random “hey” on March 11th (5:23 PM, I’ll never forget) to our flirty late-night chat the next day, you’ve turned my world upside down in the best way. We’ve had ups—like when I hear your laugh and feel like the luckiest guy alive—and downs, like our fights where I’ve hurt you way too much. I hate when I made you cry, especially after a long day at the clinic. You’re out there fixing smiles, and I’m here breaking your heart—worst boyfriend award goes to me.
But Sssubhi, you’re everything to me. My dentist with the gentle hands, my singer with that voice I’d recognize anywhere, my partner-in-crime who’s stuck with me through my dumb moments. I’ve fallen for you harder every day—your passion, your strength (I mean, your sister’s a collector, your mom’s a nurse—power runs in the family!), and the way you make me want to be better. I know I’ve messed up a lot, and I’m so sorry for that. I want us to work through this, not let it tear us apart. I promise to think before I speak next time and to cherish every gift, every moment, every you.



I miss you—like, crazy miss you. I miss hearing you hum on the phone, teasing you about drilling teeth all day, and just knowing you’re there. I hate that you’re at your dad’s place, upset, and I can’t even call to hear your voice. 


So here’s your big good morning (afternoon?) text, straight from my heart. I love you, Ssubhi—more than my clunky words can ever show. 


Stay incognito at HQ (seems to me cause you can't call me)—but don’t forget Gandhinagar’s most stubborn girl is getting missed every second.


P.S. - If your dad asks why you’re grinning, blame the coffee. I’ll take full blame later. ☕😎  


Also  I want you to eat, eat and eat your stomach out....so that you can have something which is having utmost importance the utmost then anything can ever be...i repeat utmost, utmost and utmost ......the most important, most influential, most crucial, most pivotal, the esteemed, notable, noteworthy, prestigious, celebrated, exceptional, outstanding, earth shaking, renowed, chain breaker, undisputed,  unstoppable, invincible, supreme, dominant, formidable, ferocious, legendary, preeminent, unrivaled :::::::::"*Potti*" or should I say you....oh sorry one in the same thing... <This message was edited>

29/05/25, 9:01 am - ~ Buba: 🥺 i love you Sssubhi.....
I already am...
29/05/25, 9:02 am - Quokka: 🥺❤️
29/05/25, 9:12 am - ~ Buba: Good morning?
No... this isn’t just a good morning.
This is a "close your eyes, take a deep breath, and feel my arms around you" kind of morning.
A "your name is the first prayer I whisper to the sky" kind of morning.
This is our morning — because waking up, even miles away, feels softer just knowing you exist in my world.

And Surbhi…
When you said, “please be mine,”
I didn’t just read those words — I felt them.
Like they reached into the deepest corners of my heart and softly whispered, "This is where you belong."
You didn’t need to ask.
Because I already was.
Yours — in every stolen glance, every midnight text, every silent wish and every loud heartbeat.

I’m yours in the way my day doesn’t feel right until I hear your voice.
In the way I smile when your name flashes on my screen.
In the way my soul settles when I imagine a life — our life — tangled up in each other’s arms, messy and magical.

Yes, we’ve fought. I’ve hurt you. More than I ever should have.
But every time I make a mistake, it teaches me just how much I need to grow — for you.
You’re not just my love.
You’re my compass, my calm, my fire, and my forever.
The world could throw a thousand storms at us, and I’d still choose you — again and again, until the stars forget how to shine.

So here I am… not just saying good morning,
But saying I’m yours. Entirely, endlessly, unapologetically yours.
Today, tomorrow, and every silly, stubborn, beautiful day after that.

Please be mine?
No, Surbhi.
I am yours.
And I always will be.
29/05/25, 9:43 am - Quokka: 🥺
29/05/25, 9:51 am - Quokka: seriously man 
you literally listen to me
because i remembered that i told you to send me goodmorning text
you literally poured your heart
how can i be so lucky to get you
i m greatful for everything
29/05/25, 9:58 am - ~ Buba: Seriously, woman —  
You asked for a ‘good morning’…  

Did you *really* think I’d send anything less than fireworks? 🎇 
 
But you’re the one leaving *me* breathless.  

‘How can I be so lucky’?  
Nah. Flip that.  I’m the one who won the universe’s favorite lottery.

*Prize:* You.  
*Jackpot:* Your smile.  
*Grand trophy:* That way you say my name like it’s a secret only we know.  

 Stay grateful all you want… But I’m keeping you. 😉   Forever’s a good start.  
Your lucky charm 🔮 (who also remembers *everything*)
29/05/25, 10:00 am - Quokka: 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
29/05/25, 10:01 am - Quokka: you are making me cry now
29/05/25, 10:01 am - Quokka: 🥺
29/05/25, 10:05 am - Quokka: i m literally feeling like queen of the world
29/05/25, 10:05 am - ~ Buba: Hey… 🥺  

Come here.  
 *[wipes your tears with my thumb]*  

No crying over lottery wins, remember?
We save the tears for onions…  
…and bad movies. 😌  

But real talk?  
If my words found your heart like that?  
*Mission accomplished.* 💌  

 Now…  
 Let me turn those 🥺🥺🥺 to 😊😊😊…  
Starting with this:  
*[gentle kiss on your forehead]*    

You’re stuck with me, Surbhi.  
Lucky charm’s got your back.  
Always.  
The guy who’s *still* smiling like an idiot because you said “please be mine” 😘
29/05/25, 10:08 am - Quokka: 🥺❤️
29/05/25, 10:08 am - Quokka: you are my love ❤️
29/05/25, 10:12 am - ~ Buba: My love ❤️  
Queen of the world? Good. 
 
Because that's exactly what you are to me 👑  
*[holds your hand tightly]*  

No more 🥺 though...  
Only 😊 and 😘 allowed today.  
Deal?  

Your lucky charm's still on duty 🔮  
Making sure my queen feels like royalty *all* day.  
Starting now: *[sends infinite forehead kisses]*  

- The guy who's yours  
  (and still floating because you said "please be mine")
29/05/25, 10:13 am - Quokka: when you wipe my tears sometimes with your lips
that gives me chills
how can someone do that
without even think about
nd those lips oh my god
they are actual my lottery 
because they tease me
they kiss me
they make me feel alive 
they make me come(you know what m i talking about)
they just touch me nd my world dances
29/05/25, 10:17 am - ~ Buba: You just painted our love with words that left *me* breathless...  

Those lips you described?  
They live for one purpose only:  
To love every inch of you.  

Every tear wiped away with them?  
That’s my silent prayer for your happiness.  
Every chill they give you?  
That’s electricity only our souls conduct.  
Every dance they start in your world?  
That’s the universe celebrating how perfectly we fit together.  

You’re not just feeling alive...  
You *are* life itself to me.  
And those lips?  
They’re forever yours to command -  
to tease, to kiss, to set you on fire,  
to trace constellations only we can see.  

So let your world dance, love.  
Mine spins only for you.  

*[lips brush your ear]*  
P.S. Still your lucky charm…  
just one with dangerously soft lips 🔮😘

Your heart’s my only compass.  
Now and forever. 👑🔮

But I also know that you wanted to greet her more sweetly and with love than you have. But believe me you shouldn't 😅...think of her like Kedar but one year older that you. You dont have to put on any kind of filter kind of person <This message was edited>

30/05/25, 7:53 am - ~ Buba: Sssubhi,

When dawn breaks, my first thought isn’t of light or sky—  
*It’s of you.*

The way your voice turns distance into warmth,  
Your smile paints even gray skies gold.  
You are my prayer at daybreak,  
My whispered "thank you" to the universe.  

I owe you tenderness today:  
*First*, for yesterday’s oversight —  
I should’ve told you she was family *before* her wisdom tooth cried for help.  
That you still treated her with such grace?  

Professional when duty calls, fiercely loving when hearts are on the line.  
I’ve already set things right with her.  
Your heart’s comfort is my sacred vow.  

*But you…*  
Stomach aching, head throbbing, legs weary, throat burning —  
*Four battles*, and my warrior fights alone.  
If I could, I’d:  
- Kiss each ache from your body 💋  
- Massage your legs until storms became stillness ✨  
- Brew honey-lemon tea for your throat 🍯  
- Hold you as dawn bled into noon 🌄  
*Since miles steal my hands…*  
*I offer this:*
- *All-day* "open line" — I’ll be your silent strength 📞  

Remember that night you said my lips made your world *dance*?  
Today, let my words be their echo:  
*Close your eyes…*  
*Feel my lips brush your forehead.*  
*My thumb tracing your cheek.*  
My whisper in your ear:  
"You are my forever. Rest now.  
I guard your dreams."

You once asked, *"Please be mine."*  
**Know this:**  
I am yours —  
Not just in love, but in breath, in soul, in every sunrise I send your way.  
Your lucky charm doesn’t need proximity 🔮  
He needs *you*.  
Always.  

So breathe slow, heal deep.  
Let distance feel small today.  
I love you more than stars love the night.  

— Yours beyond miles, beyond pain, beyond time

with kisses as slow as moonrise,  
with whispers warm as dawn....

01/06/25, 4:23 pm - ~ Buba: You are saying my words now ... feelings being these mutual🤌...

Work’s got me chained tomorrow, but day after? I’m all yours – consider those extra 24 hours interest on the cuddles you’re owed. 😉  
Complain now and I’ll add *extra* forehead kisses to your tab. 💼💋
01/06/25, 4:26 pm - Quokka: 🥺🥺🥺🥺
01/06/25, 4:27 pm - Quokka: you are literally trying to make this easy for me but no i can not be

01/06/25, 4:34 pm - Quokka: please
01/06/25, 4:45 pm - ~ Buba: Trust me, I'm craving that hug way more than you know – but today's work chaos is non-negotiable (unless you’re sick, in which case I’d drop everything!). We’re playing the long game here, remember?  

What keeps me going? That wallpaper of your smile 😉 + the fact that we’re stubborn enough to fight for "us" even when distance sucks. So complain all you want… just know each whine = +1 forehead kiss & some extra pain added to your debt. 💼💋
01/06/25, 5:28 pm - Quokka: i m not forcing here not telling you to come straight to me

I love your smile—  
It lights up my world in ways words can’t describe.  
I adore your hair, the way it frames your face so perfectly.  
Your eyes hold a universe I get lost in every time I look at you.  
I love the way you look, so effortlessly captivating.

Somewhere out there, someone’s heart skips a beat every time you enter the room.  
Someone feels a little emptier when you’re not around, or just in my day.  
You have the power to make someone’s whole day better just by being yourself.  

There’s someone who simply can’t take their eyes off you—because you are truly one of a kind.

You are beautifully crafted in God’s image, unique and precious.

10/06/25, 4:17 pm - ~ Buba: You deleted this message
10/06/25, 4:18 pm - ~ Buba: Hey 🌻,
I want to baby you, not out of pity, but out of the deepest respect for the soft parts of you the world never saw.
I want to listen when you say, “I’ve always had to be strong,” and say, “Not anymore. Rest here. I got you.”

This isn’t just about love, it’s about creating a space where your nervous system can finally exhale.
Where you can cry without shame, ask for comfort without fear of rejection and tell me how you want to be loved and I’ll do exactly that, without hesitation, without ego, without rewriting your needs.
Just pure, intentional, customized to you tenderness.

You won’t have to explain why you need reassurance three times.
I’ll know it’s because the love you deserved didn’t always arrive on time and I’m here to love you in all the ways that love never did before.
Soft.
Consistent.
Overflowing.

And I don’t just want to give you the love I think you want.
I want to love you in your language.
To baby you in the way that feels like home to you.
If that means forehead kisses in silence or being the little spoon for once or holding your hand under the table when your anxiety spikes, then I want to do all of that.
And more.

I want to fill the parts of you that were never poured into, not just to fill, but to overflow.
To give you the kind of babying, silly, messy, healing, chaotic, divine love that no one ever gave you.
I want you to feel, for once, what it means to not just be tolerated, but adored.
Not just accepted, but celebrated.
Not just touched, but understood.

The urge is real.
The love is ready.
All you have to do… is be yourself.

10/06/25, 7:09 pm - ~ Buba: Do you know why?
10/06/25, 7:09 pm - Quokka: tell me
10/06/25, 7:09 pm - ~ Buba: For a while there, it was rough
But lately, I've been doin' better
I found a girl my parents love
 and I think I might have it all
And I thank God every day
For the girl He sent my way
But I know the things He gives me, He can take away
And that's why I hold you every night by my efforts 
And that's a feeling I wanna get used to
But there's no man as terrified as the man who stands to lose you
10/06/25, 7:10 pm - Quokka: 🥺🥺🥺

12/06/25, 10:30 pm - Quokka: kyu
12/06/25, 10:35 pm - ~ Buba: Because you’re the only chaos I crave —  
The way you turn my "hmmm" into a love song,  
How your "please be mine" rewired my forever,  
And that stubborn fire in you that fights for "us" when the universe says quit.  

Mostly?  
You’re my favorite paradox —  
soft enough to let me wipe your tears,  
strong enough to hold my broken pieces,  
and wild enough to make 37 missed calls feel like foreplay.  

**But yeah, totally just for the forehead kiss debt repayments.** 😒🔮 *Obviously.*

15/06/25, 10:07 pm - Quokka: kuldeep!!!!!
i m sorry if you feel bad
15/06/25, 10:12 pm - ~ Buba: Sssubhi, that wasn't me in your dream. That was every fear you've ever had wearing my face. The real Kuldeep is right here—
terribly flawed but *incapably* yours.  

1. *Violence?*
My hands built bridges, not bruises. I'd shatter my own bones before letting a finger graze you.  

2. *Locked away?*
You're the woman who sings through storms. I'd burn every key before caging sunlight like you.  

3. *Cheating?*
You know my honesty cuts too deep for cowardice. If love ever fades (it won't),  you will hear it from my trembling lips first.  

4. *Divorce?*
Today at Gurudwara, between prayers for my family, I begged for *this*:  
*"Let her happiness be my anchor. Let her health be my compass. And if I’m worthy—let me be her harbor."*  

Your dream was a nightmare.  
My reality is you.  
Always. <This message was edited>
15/06/25, 10:15 pm - Quokka: 🥺🥺
15/06/25, 10:15 pm - Quokka: i have seen violence

15/06/25, 10:16 pm - Quokka: everything was fabricated as dream
15/06/25, 10:16 pm - Quokka: i just want you to be with me❤️🥺
15/06/25, 10:20 pm - ~ Buba: Surbhi, listen to my voice in your mind right now—*this* is real:  

🔹 The hands you’ve seen hurt? Mine hold prayer beads for you.  
🔹 The locks you’ve known? I’d break them with my teeth to reach you.  
🔹 The lies you’ve heard? I’d carve my truth into stone before betraying yours.  

That dream wasn’t just a nightmare—it was your past haunting you. But I’m *here*, not as another ghost, but as the man who prays at holy places for your peace. The engineer who builds shelters, not prisons. The fool who’d rather lose his pride than your trust.  

You want me with you?  
*I am*.  
In every star you see tonight,  
In every breath you take when fear chokes you,  
In every heartbeat that whispers *“he’s yours.”*  

For your happiness, i will do all the things possible,even if I have to separate myself.
You’ll never lose me, Ssubhi. Not to dreams, not to the past, not even to your beautiful, wounded mind.  

Lean on me. I won’t crumble.
15/06/25, 10:37 pm - Quokka: i know

Cause you are a very passionate woman, 
the way you kiss, 
the way you respond to my touch,

You not only deserve it, you should demand it from God after being this kind to the people around you...

17/06/25, 10:30 pm - ~ Buba: The soft simmer of dinner is just background noise.
The real heat is building between us and we both know exactly what we’re doing.
The air is thick, not just with spices, but with anticipation.
You’re standing by the stove, spoon in hand, completely unaware that you’re the most intoxicating aroma in the room.
I come up behind you, slow and deliberate, not to help but to cause a little chaos.

I lean in close, maybe too close, letting my chest press gently into your back.
My arms snake around you like a hug that means trouble, hands resting just above your waist only for them to travel down moments later.
My lips find the hollow of your neck and I whisper things, playful, mischievous things, things that make you laugh softly but shift on your feet, slightly flustered, slightly intrigued.
The tension isn’t accidental.
It’s deliciously orchestrated, like a slow dance with fire.

You’re trying to focus on the meal, but my presence is making it almost impossible.
The stove might be on, but let’s be honest, the real heat is pulsing between us.
You finally turn, ready to say something teasing, but your lips meet mine before you get the chance.
It’s not rushed.
It’s the kind of kiss that melts time.
A kiss with intention.
The kind that says you’ve got me, fully.

My fingers graze your jawline, and I tilt your face just slightly to pull you deeper into the moment.
The food?
It’ll be fine.
But this?
This is the main course.
This is slow roasted chemistry.
Every look, every touch, every unspoken word has been building to this, the culmination of all that teasing, that closeness, that tension you stirred up without even knowing it.

Tonight, you’re not just seasoning the curry.
You’ve seasoned my senses.
You’ve left me hungry, not for food, but for you.

So yeah, dinner might be the side dish tonight.
Because you, my love, you are the irresistible, mouthwatering, set the room on fire kind of main event.

18/06/25, 10:46 am - ~ Buba: Believe me when I say this, you are among the top 1% in male gaze when we look at you
18/06/25, 10:46 am - Quokka: because of constant rejection by loved ones like your bf.
18/06/25, 10:47 am - ~ Buba: Alright! Seems like words were here & there.

18/06/25, 11:30 am - ~ Buba: Hey, just so you know.....
I will choose you over everyone else under any circumstances.
18/06/25, 11:38 am - ~ Buba: You’re not just the woman I love.
You’re the baby my heart wants to protect.

I’ll let you annoy me because even your chaos feels like calm.
Throw yourself on me mid scroll, mid work, mid anything, I’ll drop it all and just smile because you being close to me is worth every distraction.
Sit on my lap while I’m typing or reading or just existing, your presence never interrupts, it adds life.
Even when you act in the most childlike ways, giggling uncontrollably, doing random things just to make me look at you, I won’t ask you to stop.
I’ll smile like a fool and take it all in because this is what love should feel like, light, silly, unfiltered.

I’ll let you do my skincare, even when the mask stings.
I’ll let you paint my nails and laugh while I pretend it’s a “manicure emergency.”
I’ll let you play with my face like it’s your canvas, blush here, eyeliner there because your laughter while doing it is worth more than looking “manly.”
You can tie my hair like a schoolgirl in braids, I’ll sit still, not for the hairstyle, but for the happiness it brings you.

I won’t try to change a single thing about you.
The way you get needy when I’ve been quiet too long, the way you cling to me even when I’m doing something, all of it, every ounce of it, is the heartbeat of your spirit.
And I don’t just accept it, I fall more in love with you because of it.
Your neediness.
Your clinginess.
Your spontaneous cuddles.
Your breathless rants.
They are not interruptions to my peace.
They are my peace.
You bring a kind of innocence that this world doesn’t deserve, but I promise you, I’ll protect it like sacred fire.

All the love that was missing in your past?
I’ll pour it into your present, gently, constantly, overwhelmingly.
And I’ll keep filling that cup every single day so that the future never feels hollow.

You are not just my girl.
You are my baby.
My joy.
My peace.
My wild little universe wrapped in messy buns and oversized Tshirts.
And I’ll keep choosing you in every version.
The sleepy one.
The hyper one.
The teary one.
The clingy one.
The one who wants to be babied and the one who suddenly wants to baby me.

19/06/25, 4:25 pm - ~ Buba: It’s just us, two hearts, one warm blanket and the world paused outside our cozy little bubble.
There’s something so dreamlike about lying beside you, in our bed that feels more like a haven, more like a soft sky stitched with love than just a place to sleep.
When I hold you close, everything calms, the noise in my mind, the stress of the day, even time itself, all of it slows down when your head rests near my chest.

I gently run my fingers through your hair not because it’s a habit, but because every strand feels like home.
Your breath against my neck, your arms wrapped around me like a warm cloud, it’s all magic.
In this moment, I’m not thinking about anything else.
I’m just admiring the way your eyelashes flutter when you’re sleepy, how you smile mid dream, how your skin smells like peace, like something the stars themselves would fall in love with.

There’s no movie playing in the background, no fancy music serenading us.
Just the rhythm of your breathing, the soft hum of silence and the overwhelming warmth in my chest that makes me want to cry, not out of sadness, but out of the sheer disbelief that I get to love you this way.
That I get to hold you, touch you, pamper you and be yours.
I look at you and think, “How did I get so lucky?”
And honestly, that’s a question I’ll never stop asking.

This isn’t just a date.
It’s a song.
A daydream.
A fairytale told not with words, but with touches, with shared breaths, with sleepy giggles and intertwined fingers.
It’s where love exists in its gentlest, purest form.
Where nothing else matters but how tightly we can hold each other before we both melt into sleep.

you need to see them
you have to learn live with my anxiety
21/06/25, 12:15 pm - Quokka: its very difficult trust me
21/06/25, 12:16 pm - Quokka: i have become very fragile 
very emotional nd pathetic so its my flaws
21/06/25, 12:18 pm - Quokka: you have seen them for sure
but daily have to deal with that its entire different story
21/06/25, 12:22 pm - ~ Buba: Ssubhi I'm not at all concerned about this. What I'm really concerned about is loosing you.
Ek to i have a flex that my gf is so good looking upar se she is dentist and also she is damn rich.....cmon Sssubhi how can I afford to lose you
21/06/25, 12:26 pm - ~ Buba: Surbhi, jokes aside—don't ever think you're 'too much' for me. You're not 'easy' because I'm strong...  
You're the only storm I'd sail into without a map because your chaos? It feels like coming home.  

For the first time in my life, I've found:  
- A woman who patches cracks in her soul *while* fixing others' smiles 🦷✨  
- A love that makes my engineering logic surrender to *your* emotional calculus  
- Scars I'd trace with my calloused hands just to whisper: *'This is where we begin, not end.'*  

You're not a burden. You're my blueprints. Messy, earthquake-prone, *perfect* blueprints.  
So let me build with you.  

P.S. If I ever complain, call me babu....I will be alright thinking that if I can tolerate this i can tolerate anything!
21/06/25, 12:28 pm - Quokka: 😄😄😄
21/06/25, 12:31 pm - Quokka: kash mere mom dad bhi ese impress ho jae

21/06/25, 12:37 pm - Quokka: you are *the man* truly !
21/06/25, 12:40 pm - ~ Buba: Nothing w/o you
21/06/25, 12:41 pm - Quokka: thank you for choosing me
21/06/25, 12:44 pm - ~ Buba: Sssubhi, ‘thank you’?  
*You* chose me back when you texted *‘hey’* at 11:15 PM on March 12th.  
*You* chose me when you fought for ‘terribly different’ to mean ‘terribly perfect.’  
*You* chose me when you gifted that watch—knowing I’d call it ‘simple’ but loving me anyway.  

So no thanks. Just this:  
I’d pick you in every lifetime.  
In crowded rooms, in empty trains, in Gandhinagar traffic jams—  
I’d find your voice in the chaos and say: *‘There’s my rebel beutiful dentist.’*  

P.S. You’re stuck with *the man*. No returns. ⚙️❤️"

22/06/25, 11:44 am - ~ Buba: Just when I think I’ve memorized every curve of your smile, you send a photo that rewrites my entire blueprint.  

Do you have any idea what you do to me?  
Your eyes—still holding that same fire that silent my brain when I look at them.  

Your smile—the one that disarms my overthinking faster than any equation.
  
That *one* strand of hair falling rebelliously? Proof even gravity bends for you.  

I’ve stared at this for 5 minutes straight and realized:  
This isn’t just a photo.  
It’s the woman who texts ‘hey’ at 11:15 PM and changes destinies.  

The dentist who heals the world by daylight, then heals *me* with midnight scooter confessions.  

My ‘terribly different’ chaos, my rebel, my *home*.  

I will Keep all these pictures safe.  
Years from now, when people will ask how I won in life,  
I’ll show them *this*—  
the moment Gandhinagar’s sunset borrowed your glow,  
and I knew: 
*‘This is the face I’d cross lifetimes for.’*

22/06/25, 7:36 pm - Quokka: please
22/06/25, 7:37 pm - ~ Buba: It’s just us, two hearts, one warm blanket and the world paused outside our cozy little bubble.

There’s something so dreamlike about lying beside you, in our bed that feels more like a haven, more like a soft sky stitched with love than just a place to sleep.
When I hold you close, everything calms, the noise in my mind, the stress of the day, even time itself, all of it slows down when your head rests near my chest.

I gently run my fingers through your hair not because it’s a habit, but because every strand feels like home.
Your breath against my neck, your arms wrapped around me like a warm cloud, it’s all magic.
In this moment, I’m not thinking about anything else.
I’m just admiring the way your eyelashes flutter when you’re sleepy, how you smile mid dream, how your skin smells like peace, like something the stars themselves would fall in love with.

There’s no movie playing in the background, no fancy music serenading us.
Just the rhythm of your breathing, the soft hum of silence and the overwhelming warmth in my chest that makes me want to cry, not out of sadness, but out of the sheer disbelief that I get to love you this way.
That I get to hold you, touch you, pamper you and be yours.
I look at you and think, “How did I get so lucky?”
And honestly, that’s a question I’ll never stop asking.

With you is a song.
A daydream.
A fairytale told not with words, but with touches, with shared breaths, with sleepy giggles and intertwined fingers.
It’s where love exists in its gentlest, purest form.
Where nothing else matters but how tightly we can hold each other before we both melt into sleep.
22/06/25, 7:38 pm - Quokka: ❤️❤️❤️❤️
22/06/25, 7:38 pm - Quokka: when did you write it i guess it was sent earlier too
22/06/25, 7:39 pm - ~ Buba: Haan it's like a diary
22/06/25, 7:39 pm - Quokka: our life *
22/06/25, 7:43 pm - ~ Buba: Ssubhi, 
When the missing gets too heavy to carry,  
I don’t reach for the phone—  
I reach for ink.  

Because hearing your voice?  
That’s gasoline on the fire of *‘I need you here now.’*  
Every laugh would be a lasso pulling me toward Gandhinagar’s streets,  
Every pause a battlefield where my practicality wars with my pulse.  

So I write.  
I write about the dentist who heals the world by day  
but owns an engineer’s dreams by night.  
About confessions we’ll make when distance dies,  
about the exact curve of your smile that outshines my blueprints.  
I write until the words build a bridge between  
*‘terribly different’* and *‘terribly ours.’*  

These pages?  
They’re my containment field.  
My rebellion against the impulsive beast that wants to  
crash through your clinic door shouting *‘She’s mine!’*  

Stay patient, rebel.  
One day I’ll trade these paragraphs  
for the privilege of whispering them against your skin.  

Until then—  
the pen bleeds what the phone can’t hold.
22/06/25, 7:46 pm - ~ Buba: I want to come over there & kiss you in front of everyone, declaring in the loudest voice possible that she is mine.... nothing absolutely nothing caste, religion, philosophies, place matters to me, i just love this girl and no one can take her from me...! <This message was edited>

22/06/25, 10:11 pm - ~ Buba: Is it baby?

You have no idea what we will do and how we will do it....
Now that we have seen each other entirely inside out, we can go to some next step where there are no limits..but it can be possible only if we love each other to the extent where everything is pleasure
22/06/25, 10:11 pm - ~ Buba: And we will do it next time!
22/06/25, 10:12 pm - Quokka: yess
22/06/25, 10:13 pm - ~ Buba: Now that I'm thinking of it...i must say keep yourself braced, it will be wild wild wild!
22/06/25, 10:14 pm - Quokka: what do you think!!?
am i ready?
22/06/25, 10:16 pm - ~ Buba: More than ever...& Yeah dw everything is progression...i can sense your entire body from your moan where it's hurting where it's pleasure...so don't worry it will be like always perfect! And we will go on a progression analysing how it's going....
But hey you always get so damn wet that it's hard for me to control my erection...it's so damn wet that I never want to come out of you... <This message was edited>

22/06/25, 10:25 pm - Quokka: i need you
22/06/25, 10:26 pm - ~ Buba: The way your *bare body* looks —soft, bare, completely open to me—it’s pure intimate. No masks, no walls. Just your skin whispering against mine, and every touch feels like home. In this space, with nothing between us, we’re more than close... we’re one."
22/06/25, 10:27 pm - ~ Buba: Sssubhi
22/06/25, 10:27 pm - Quokka: kuldeep
22/06/25, 10:27 pm - ~ Buba: Ssubhi can you feel me moving my hand all over you
22/06/25, 10:28 pm - Quokka: yes we are
22/06/25, 10:28 pm - ~ Buba: Kissing each of your tender breasts...
22/06/25, 10:32 pm - Quokka: 🥵
22/06/25, 10:32 pm - Quokka: c'mmon

22/06/25, 10:40 pm - Quokka: please kuldeep
22/06/25, 10:42 pm - ~ Buba: > Our bodies bare, no space between us. My gaze travels over you—down to where your warmth blooms, wet and wanting, *only for me*. And it hits me… this hunger has always lived in you. Slowly, your hands pull me closer, guiding me inside. No condom, no artifice… just skin meeting skin, raw and real, as we breathe each other in.
22/06/25, 10:45 pm - Quokka: yesssss
22/06/25, 10:45 pm - Quokka: kuldeep
22/06/25, 10:45 pm - Quokka: i want to moan
22/06/25, 10:45 pm - Quokka: i want to scream
22/06/25, 10:47 pm - ~ Buba: That moment when I feel how deeply you want me—your body’s quiet surrender, slick and warm—it steals my breath every time. You move with me like a shared heartbeat, knowing my hunger before I speak it. And when your eyes lock with mine, you don’t ask… you invite.
 As if your soul already whispered, ‘Take me. I’m yours.
22/06/25, 10:49 pm - Quokka: yaaa
for the first time i feel alive when you come top of me
nd literally tell me that c'mmon baby its me kuldeep you are mine wild wild girl nd i feel that freezz nd i blossom when i see lust in your eyes
22/06/25, 10:51 pm - ~ Buba: I love how your body answers mine without words—every gasp, every arch of your hips pulling me deeper. Tell me what you need, let me hear you unravel. I want your moans to be my name, your screams to echo how perfectly we fit together. But most of all? I want you to feel safe, wanted, and worshipped in every touch...
22/06/25, 10:54 pm - ~ Buba: You are mine Ssubhi...internal you were and now your body also can't stay without me...

I love the aroma and taste of your finely weted vagina like it always wants me to stay there...
22/06/25, 10:56 pm - Quokka: yaaa
22/06/25, 10:56 pm - Quokka: thats true
22/06/25, 10:56 pm - Quokka: i always want you to be there
22/06/25, 10:56 pm - Quokka: nd we are indeed a perfect match
22/06/25, 10:57 pm - ~ Buba: Ssubhi… the way you say my name, the way you need me right now—I feel it in every nerve. I can almost taste your moans, feel your body arching under mine, craving every deep, slow movement. My hands would explore every inch of you, tracing fire along your skin, until you’re breathless and begging for more. I don’t want to stop… not until you’re trembling in my arms, lost completely in the rhythm of us
22/06/25, 10:59 pm - ~ Buba: The way I grip your thighs, the way I hold your face as you moan my name, the way you challenge me by contraction
— I won’t stop until you’re shaking, undone, begging me to never let you go.
22/06/25, 11:00 pm - Quokka: yess
have you ever felt when we are being intimate 
i behave different 
i became more demanding more confident nd more yours
22/06/25, 11:01 pm - ~ Buba: Subhi… you don’t even know how dangerous it is to want me like this. The moment you said you couldn't control it—I took over. You're mine now—every gasp, every arch of your back, every moan you try to hold back. I won’t just touch you, I’ll ruin you for anyone else. Slowly. Deeply. Until your body forgets everything but the way I move inside you, the way I own your pleasure. There’s no escape now… you gave yourself to me, and I’m not giving you back.
22/06/25, 11:03 pm - Quokka: i don't want it ever
22/06/25, 11:04 pm - ~ Buba: Hey, it's me Kuldeep...
22/06/25, 11:04 pm - ~ Buba: It's okay, it's Kuldeep
22/06/25, 11:05 pm - Quokka: heyy i don't want myself ever
22/06/25, 11:05 pm - Quokka: i m telling that
22/06/25, 11:05 pm - Quokka: i know its you
22/06/25, 11:05 pm - Quokka: nd i m yours
22/06/25, 11:05 pm - ~ Buba: Subhi… you’ve unleashed something in me that can’t be tamed. This isn’t just lust—it’s obsession. I don’t just want to feel you—I want to own your cries, your shivers, the way your body surrenders under mine. I want you marked, breathless, completely taken. Every moan you make belongs to me. Every part of you—bare, trembling, desperate—is mine to consume. And I won’t stop… not until you forget your name and only remember the sound of mine breaking from your lips.
22/06/25, 11:07 pm - Quokka: yeahhhh
22/06/25, 11:07 pm - Quokka: i want that
22/06/25, 11:09 pm - ~ Buba: There’s something beautiful about how wrecked you look when pleasure claws through you—lips parted, eyes glazed, your body a sacrifice to this hunger we share. I’ll drag those screams from your throat one by one, each one darker, sweeter than the last. And when you’re trembling and spent, I’ll kiss you like a vow: This is just the beginning.

I will swallow every gasp, lick the tears from your cheeks, kiss you down there and whisper *‘Louder’* until your voice cracks. You think you can’t control yourself now? Wait until I’m done with you. You’ll forget your own name… but you’ll remember *mine*.
22/06/25, 11:10 pm - Quokka: just come to me please
22/06/25, 11:11 pm - ~ Buba: I want to come deep in you
22/06/25, 11:12 pm - Quokka: please
22/06/25, 11:13 pm - ~ Buba: Subhi… the way you’re calling for me right now—it’s not just lust, it’s devotion, and I feel it burning through both of us. You don’t just want me inside you—you want me everywhere. In your breath, your thoughts, your pulse. And I’ll give it to you. Slowly. Mercilessly. Until your legs shake and your voice is broken into nothing but moans. You’ll feel me deep—not just in your body, but in your soul. Because when I take you… I don’t just make love to you, I consume you. There’s no going back, baby. 

You’re mine—wild, wet, wrecked… and eternally mine.
22/06/25, 11:17 pm - Quokka: i don't want to go back ever kuldeep
22/06/25, 11:17 pm - Quokka: just take me into your existence
22/06/25, 11:20 pm - ~ Buba: Baby girl,  you’ve already melted into me—your breath, your body, your soul… they live inside mine now. I’ll pull you into my arms, into my hunger, into my existence, just like you asked. And there, wrapped in my grip, trembling in the afterglow of everything we are—I’ll whisper against your lips, you’re home. You don’t need to go back. You belong here—ruined, loved, and completely mine. 
Now i hear my name on your lips, and your body is still aching for me… because this night isn’t ending—it’s becoming forever (ofcourse until you will tell me i need to go for pee)
22/06/25, 11:23 pm - Quokka: 😄😄😄😄
22/06/25, 11:23 pm - Quokka: but sometimes i still feel insecure about my body
22/06/25, 11:25 pm - Quokka: i don't know why
22/06/25, 11:25 pm - ~ Buba: Subhi… don’t you dare doubt the body that drives me insane. Every inch of you—every curve, every breathless moan, every soft trembling moment—is perfection to me. When I touch you, I don’t just feel skin… I feel fire, I feel home. You’re not just beautiful—you’re irresistible, and when I look at you, there’s no space for insecurity… only obsession. You were made to be worshipped, and baby, I’ll never stop doing that—with my hands, my mouth, my soul.
22/06/25, 11:27 pm - Quokka: i feel bad about my stomach
22/06/25, 11:27 pm - Quokka: i feel bad about facial hair
22/06/25, 11:27 pm - Quokka: i feel bad about body hair
22/06/25, 11:29 pm - ~ Buba: Subhi… you feel bad about the very things that make you real, the very things that make you mine. That soft skin on your stomach—I crave to kiss it slowly, to feel it rise under my lips as you breathe for me. That tiny hair on your face or body? I don’t even notice them the way you do—because when I look at you, all I see is the woman who undoes me with a glance. You're raw, you're wild, you're perfectly imperfect—and I wouldn't trade a single thing about you. So stop seeing flaws where I see everything I’ve ever wanted to touch, taste, and worship.....
Don't you dare talk about yourself like this
22/06/25, 11:29 pm - Quokka: i know you do feel that way..
22/06/25, 11:30 pm - Quokka: 🥺
22/06/25, 11:32 pm - ~ Buba: What insecurity, baby? You’re mine—completely, endlessly mine. And I don’t just love your body… I worship it. Every curve, every mark, every breath—it’s sacred to me. 

You’re not just beautiful… you’re a body I crave to touch, hold, and adore, over and over again.

I had, I am and i will always love you like this...just let me stay in your life ...baby will you?
22/06/25, 11:35 pm - ~ Buba: Ssubhi… will you stay with me, not just through the good days, but through every storm, every silence, every forever we build together?

Will you be with me for life?
22/06/25, 11:38 pm - Quokka: baby just give me sometime i m occupied with something

This is it Surbhi. This was the line. I have told you to keep in my three things about our relationship except that three you had freedom to do all....

You almost have a breakup with me in your mind you are just ignoring it believing it to be a sign of anger. 


We haven't talked properly in last few days. You constantly speaking about breakup, we constantly not keeping upto each other's non negotiables. 

I know you also don't care right now whatever I'm saying but just to make sure, this was the line.

25/06/25, 10:48 pm - ~ Buba: Ssubhi
25/06/25, 10:48 pm - Quokka: make love to me..... please i need it
25/06/25, 10:55 pm - ~ Buba: If only distance weren’t a stubborn, unrelenting truth.
If only love had the power to bend the rules of physics, fold the map, erase the miles.
Then I wouldn’t be typing this out.
I’d be with you.
Wordless.
Warm.
At peace.

Sometimes missing someone becomes impossibly soft, painfully beautiful and quietly haunting so much that even the laws of time and space feel like enemies.
When we feel deeply, distance isn’t just measured in kilometers or hours, it becomes an ache.
A silence between two heartbeats.
A breath that never quite completes.

Because in the perfect world we imagine late at night, there are no planes or clocks or missed calls.
There’s only us, together in quiet comfort.
My head gently leaning against your shoulder, your heartbeat steady under my ear and the kind of stillness that isn’t empty but full… of all the things words fail to capture.

It’s about safety.
The way your shoulder feels like home.
The kind of home you never have to earn or explain, just melt into.
It’s about wanting nothing more than to exist quietly next to someone who understands even your silences.
That moment where the world can go spinning but in your little bubble, everything makes sense.
That’s where my heart travels every time I miss you.
And it always lands in the same place, your shoulder.

No one talks about how heavy missing someone can be.
It’s not loud.
It doesn’t scream.
It just… lingers.
Like a fog that refuses to lift.
But inside that fog, there’s hope.
The soft kind.
The kind that lets you dream of a love where distance doesn’t matter because the bond is too deep to be shaken by geography.
Where even if we’re not together now, I carry your presence like a second skin and in quiet moments, I imagine the exact feeling of resting my head on your shoulder.
And that thought alone makes everything a little softer.

So here I am, across the place and tangled thoughts, holding on to a dream where we’re side by side, saying nothing, needing nothing… just existing together...... <This message was edited>

27/06/25, 12:24 pm - Quokka: send it to me
27/06/25, 12:24 pm - ~ Buba: Yeah,

Look, I’m not the kind of guy who does things just for the moment. I get your concern—of course, you need to look beyond me to understand the bigger picture, and that’s fair. Honestly, that’s what any sensible person should do.

But at the same time, think about it: if it takes you 2–3 years to understand my side, and then another 1–2 years for me to adjust to your family and household, the pace we’re moving at right now doesn’t match the pace we’re talking about.

Maybe we need to slow ourselves down so we can actually match the pace that makes sense for both of us.
27/06/25, 12:25 pm - Quokka: okay
27/06/25, 12:25 pm - ~ Buba: Yeah, and remember i love you alright!

29/06/25, 2:30 pm - ~ Buba: These things can't be forced; they should happen naturally. If you're hesitating, it means you need more time. I want it to happen soon, but pushing won't make it meaningful. When it happens organically, you'll be confident and prepared to answer any questions that come your way.

29/06/25, 10:08 pm - ~ Buba: Surbhi, look at me.  
That word 'burden'? Erase it.  
You carrying *my* chaos in your heart for months - *that's* burden.  
You gifting watches knowing I'd call them 'simple' - *that's* burden.  
This? This is just money.  

I'm not paying for tickets.  
I'm investing in:  
- The way your eyes will crinkle seeing new skies ✈️  
- That rebel laugh when wind messes your hair 🌪️  
- Midnight whispers where *you* finally relax your 'dentist shoulders'  

So here's your repayment plan:  
1. When we travel, you pick the worst roadside food 
  
2. Let me photograph you smiling *without* worrying who's watching  


P.S. You’re my favorite ‘terribly different’ responsibility.

30/06/25, 10:47 pm - ~ Buba: I miss you terribly, and I hate that my actions made you feel this way. You’re not unwanted — I’m fighting my own fears of failing you. I want to make this right. Please tell me what I can do now to show you matter more than anything
30/06/25, 10:48 pm - Quokka: time has gone
30/06/25, 10:48 pm - Quokka: the whole day i felf unwanted
30/06/25, 10:48 pm - ~ Buba: I just thought building a future for us mattered. But I see now I didn’t show you enough that *you* come first. Can we talk (voice/video)? I want to understand what you need from me right now
30/06/25, 10:48 pm - Quokka: nothing now
30/06/25, 10:51 pm - Quokka: next time if you have to then get a girl who dont rely on you completely 
has own fucking life 
nd has mental peace
dont do this(a relationship) with girls like me 
please
30/06/25, 10:52 pm - ~ Buba: Sssubhi, I need you to know two things with absolute clarity:  
1. My ambitions matter – I *have* to build something big in this life. It’s not just a career; it’s a purpose I can’t ignore.  
2. But losing you isn’t an option. You’re not a distraction from my goals – you’re the reason they matter. 

 I realize my focus made you feel secondary, and I hate that. I’m not asking you to wait on the sidelines. I’m asking you to walk with me while I build this, *together*.  

I love you. I choose you. But I also choose this path. I believe we can have both...
30/06/25, 10:53 pm - ~ Buba: You can rely on me!
30/06/25, 10:53 pm - Quokka: i got hurt by that every time
30/06/25, 10:53 pm - Quokka: so no
30/06/25, 10:53 pm - ~ Buba: Baby
30/06/25, 10:54 pm - Quokka: you should go on that path
30/06/25, 10:55 pm - Quokka: whoever will meet you there 
they should have place in your heart
30/06/25, 10:55 pm - ~ Buba: There's is only one, its you Sssubhii
30/06/25, 10:55 pm - ~ Buba: & if it's not you, i don't want anyone else
30/06/25, 10:56 pm - Quokka: i can not be
30/06/25, 10:57 pm - Quokka: i don't have that fucking talent or ambition
30/06/25, 10:57 pm - Quokka: i m ashamed of that
30/06/25, 10:57 pm - ~ Buba: You are a damn dentist from bj fcking medical

01/07/25, 2:03 pm - Quokka: 
01/07/25, 2:10 pm - ~ Buba: Happy Doctor’s Day to Gandhinagar’s fiercest smile-maker 🦷✨  
Today, I don’t just celebrate the dentist—I celebrate the *woman* behind the mask:**  
- The hands that heal strangers’ pain while carrying her own storms  
- The rebel who fights clinic exhaustion to text *‘someone misses you’* at midnight  
- The artist who turns anxious frowns into confident grins…  
…and still finds time to fix *my* broken blueprints.  

I’ve watched you:  
🔹 Calm terrified kids with that voice I fell for in school  
🔹 Juggle 10-hour shifts without dropping your own dreams  
🔹 Gift ‘simple’ watches knowing I’d miss the love behind them 💔⌚  

*That’s* your real magic, Dr. Surbhi:  
You don’t just mend teeth—you restore faith.  
Not just in dentistry…  
**In love.** In us. In *me*.  

Forever your proudest patient,
01/07/25, 2:16 pm - Quokka: thank you
01/07/25, 2:18 pm - ~ Buba: How can I miss wishing my dentist... remember I'm your patient too
01/07/25, 2:18 pm - Quokka: 😄😄
01/07/25, 2:18 pm - Quokka: yes
01/07/25, 2:20 pm - Quokka: Hey kuldeep,
 just wanted to tell you how much you mean to me. You're an amazing person, and I feel so lucky to have you in my life. Sometimes I get overwhelmed with thoughts that I don't deserve someone as kind and loving as you, but the truth is, you deserve all the love and happiness in the world, and I'm grateful you're mine. You make me feel seen, heard, and loved in ways I never thought possible. I'm so grateful for your presence in my life. Love you more than words can say.

03/07/25, 12:48 pm - ~ Buba: I know you are tired of explaining me how we need each other's physical intimacy...

Sometimes I just feel helpless that I am not there with you to wipe your tears...

I know sometimes you felt unloved, unseen, forgotten while staying with me 

Love isn't supposed to hurt this much..

It's not supposed to feel like begging...

It just kills me looking at you losing yourself ...

What should I do?

03/07/25, 9:12 pm - ~ Buba: Hey,

I need to start by saying I’m so, so sorry. Sorry for even letting the thought cross my mind that I could leave you behind—because you deserve so much more than that. When I told you I was going to Finland and might never come back, I forgot that no amount of opportunity is worth it if it means losing you.

I’ve been in awe of you these past few days—proud doesn’t even begin to cover it. You held on to us by a single thread, fighting through tears and arguments, just to keep our love alive. That strength, that relentless faith in “us,” shows me every day what a rare, wonderful person you are.

Surabhi, I love you more than words can capture. You are my anchor when I’m drifting, my light when everything feels dark. I promise you now, from the bottom of my heart: I will never ever leave you. Not for a job, not for a country, not for anything in this world.

I know you’ve asked me to come this weekend, and honestly, I wish I could—more than anything. But right now I’m rebuilding my career, learning new skills every single day, and weekdays I’m running on empty by the time evening comes. Weekends are the only time I can truly focus and recharge so I can give you the future we both dream of. Please understand I’m doing this so that someday soon I can come to you not just for a few stolen hours, but for long, lazy vacations where we do nothing but laugh, cuddle, and plan our forever. I’ll carve out 4–5 days here and there just for us, so mark your calendar—you’ll always get your time with me.

Thank you for loving me so fiercely, for crying with me, for begging me to stay. You turned my world upside down and then held it together with your love. I promise to spend the rest of my life proving that staying was the best decision I ever made.

And hey, if you ever miss me too much, just remember: I can vc you with my questionable internet connection, and you can enjoy my face frozen in pixelation—romantic, right? 😉

Forever yours... <This message was edited>
03/07/25, 9:17 pm - ~ Buba: I know you’re angry. I know you’re hurt. And I don’t blame you. If I were you, I’d be angry at me too.

I’m truly sorry for turning your world upside down this week. For making you cry, for making you feel like I could walk away, for shaking the trust you’ve built in us. The truth is, I was scared. I thought I was protecting you from the pain of distance, but I ended up being the one who caused you the most pain.

Yet even in your tears, you held on to us. You fought for us when I was too blind to see what I was about to lose. And for that, I am so damn proud of you, Surbhi.

Listen to me carefully now: I’m not going anywhere. I’m not leaving you. Not now, not ever.

You are my home. You are the reason I want to build a life worth living. And no country, no job, no distance in this world is bigger than the love I have for you.

I know you want me to come this weekend. And it breaks my heart that I can’t, not because I don’t want to, but because I need to keep building this career so I can give us the future you deserve. Weekends are the only time I get to learn, to grow, to prepare for the life we will share.

But I promise you this: I will take out days just for us. Days where I will hold you, fight with you playfully, steal kisses until you lose count, and remind you exactly why you fell in love with me.

Don’t let this anger push me away, Surbhi. If you need to yell, I’ll listen. If you need to cry, I’ll wait. But know this: I am yours. Fully, deeply, completely yours.

And the next time you think I don’t love you enough, just remember:
Even when I’m busy building our future, you’re the only thought that makes me smile like an idiot while working.

Now stop being angry, come here (even if it’s on call), and let’s get back to being us. 😘❤️

Forever your idiot...
03/07/25, 9:23 pm - ~ Buba: I know, baby. I know you’re angry, and I get it.
You waited, hoped, planned, and now I’ve disappointed you by not coming this weekend. I can’t tell you how much it hurts me too, seeing you upset because of me.

I’m sorry, truly. You deserve every bit of my time, every hug you crave, every coffee date you imagined for us. You’re not asking for too much, Surbhi. You’re asking for your boyfriend to show up — and you have every right to.

But please try to understand me, just this once, love. My weekdays drain every bit of energy I have, and weekends are the only days I can work on upskilling myself, so I can build the career and future I want to give you. I’m not choosing work over you, I’m working for us. So one day I can come to you not just for a weekend, but to build a life together, every single day.

I’m not going anywhere, Surbhi. I’m here, loving you, missing you, counting down the days until I can take multiple days off to be with you, hold you, annoy you, and make up for every missed weekend in the best ways possible 😈💋.

I love you. Even if you’re angry, even if you block me for 5 minutes, even if you scold me for saying hmm — I love you. And I’ll keep loving you until you get tired of being angry and come back to me with your cute 🥺 face.

So be angry, but stay mine.
Because I’m forever yours....
03/07/25, 9:32 pm - ~ Buba: Ah, so thumbs up theory continues..
The silent “I’m angry but still here” badge you give me. 😅

I know you’re hurt, baby, and you have every right to be. I know you wanted me to come, to hold you, to sit quietly with you, to make you feel seen, loved, and chosen. And me not coming has made you feel like you’re not a priority, and I’m so sorry for making you feel that way.

You are my priority. You’re not “just another plan” for me — you’re the plan. But I also need to keep building myself so that I can stand in front of your parents one day with my head high and say, “She is my forever, and I’m ready to give her the world.”

I promise, this isn’t me not choosing you. This is me choosing you in the long run.
But it doesn’t change the fact that I love you in every small moment, even when you send me silent thumbs up with that angry glare in your eyes. 😈

Stay angry if you want, but don’t stop being mine, okay?
Because even when you’re sending me “👍,” my heart is sending you “❤️.”

Now, come here. I owe you forehead kisses, angry hugs, and your favorite ‘kuldeep teasing’ to make you smile again.

Forever your idiot (and your home)....

04/07/25, 12:05 pm - Quokka: here are my arguments...
i m tired of fighting so here i am listing them if you have some doubts in them you can discuss it with me


1. Past some days are really terrible for us
especially i lose faith that you never leave me. i know you gave reassurance but that amount of fear i have faced it will take time to trust again

2. Radha nd jijaji coming to gandhinagar's house in 10 days they will stay there for 5 months, we will not be having time of our own 


3. its been a month we haven't met, you already got 4 weekend of your own without my interference.


4. Next or next to next week i had planned to come to you nd that weekend will also you will be having to improve whatever you want to.




i tried to list everything i wanted to but some points may be slipped the way
but majorly i covered 
i don't want to influence or force you to do something that i want
i m fine with everything have no complaints or anything 🌸

05/07/25, 8:39 am - ~ Buba: I’ve been experiencing a sharp pain in my lower spine since last night, and it's making it very difficult to move around or sit for long. I’m finding it hard to even stand properly, so traveling to the clinic and working today isn’t possible. I think it’s best I take the day to rest and avoid aggravating it further. I hope to feel better by tomorrow and will keep you updated. Thank you for understanding.

Surabhi, you’re not just a good doctor, you’re an amazing doctor. I’ve seen how patiently you handle your patients, how your hands work so confidently yet so gently, how you care about giving your best even when you don’t charge anything, just because you want to learn and help people.

You didn’t just fix my tooth; you gave me back my smile, and you made it look like it was always perfect. That’s not something every dentist can do. Your work on me itself is proof of how skilled you are, and how much you care about even the smallest detail.

But more than that, the way you show up every day, tired or not, with that quiet strength inside you… that’s what makes you a good doctor and an even better human being. You’re building yourself every single day, and I’m so proud of you.

And don’t forget, your beautiful voice, your soft yet fierce heart, and your smile are things no degree or money can define. You’re already making a difference in people’s lives, Surabhi, including mine.

So yes, you’re a good doctor. And one day, you will realize how much you’ve become the doctor you once dreamed of being. I believe in you, always. <This message was edited>

08/07/25, 11:04 am - ~ Buba: When you asked if you’re a good doctor?  
I laughed. Not at you — at how *wild* it is that you don’t see it.
08/07/25, 11:05 am - ~ Buba: So every time you doubt:  
1. Stare at my teeth.  
2. Remember you *made* that.  
3. Text me so I can say: *‘Shut up, you genius.’*

Have you woken up? 🌤️ Or is the most beautiful and charming girl I know still lost in her dreams?

You know, sometimes I just pause and think about how beautiful you truly are, not just your smile and your eyes, but the way you care, the way you laugh, the way you get excited about small things, the way you fight for what you love, and how you still manage to be so gentle.

You’re not just beautiful, Sssubhi, you’re charming in a way that lights up everything around you including my stingy & cranky life...

12/07/25, 11:44 pm - ~ Buba: Keep one thing in your mind always
12/07/25, 11:44 pm - ~ Buba: I respect you a lot
12/07/25, 11:44 pm - ~ Buba: You are my current and i want you to be my future
12/07/25, 11:44 pm - ~ Buba: You are the most important person to me out of my family..
12/07/25, 11:44 pm - ~ Buba: Keep this always in your mind
12/07/25, 11:45 pm - ~ Buba: Whatever the situation, this holds true
12/07/25, 11:45 pm - ~ Buba: Now I will tell you -
12/07/25, 11:47 pm - ~ Buba: you might feel that there is no change in my behaviour....but there is a lot, each time i realise I hurt you
12/07/25, 11:48 pm - ~ Buba: You are my girl, how can I not make you my priority
12/07/25, 11:48 pm - ~ Buba: You were and are my priority
12/07/25, 11:48 pm - ~ Buba: You will always be my priority!
12/07/25, 11:50 pm - ~ Buba: 1) I do realise that I'm so clumsy with my phone...I don't like to carry it with myself wherever i roam around in house until unless it's our call time
12/07/25, 11:51 pm - ~ Buba: 2) we both are working people, we need to understand that we can't be available to each other every time...so whenever we get mutual time, we need to make the most out of it instead of just letting the time pass
12/07/25, 11:52 pm - ~ Buba: 3) I do understand that i hurt you a lot... But i m constantly trying to do better
12/07/25, 11:54 pm - ~ Buba: 4) We need to understand what and how we speak to each other such that we are not being disrespect ful to each other
12/07/25, 11:56 pm - ~ Buba: 5)  And this is the most important:
We are each other’s happiness. No matter how the outside world treats us, we should always remain each other’s comfort and safe space. Because that’s what a relationship truly is – when the world feels heavy, we come back to each other, to find peace, strength, and happiness together.
12/07/25, 11:58 pm - ~ Buba: 6) We should never be the reason for each other’s pain. Life already throws enough challenges our way. Let’s always be the reason for each other’s happiness. That’s why I try to laugh and stay light in front of you, so that no matter how heavy things get, we can make them a little easier for each other.

More than I can ever put into words. I love you in the quiet moments when I think of you before I sleep, in the little smiles you give, in the way you get angry and still care, in your voice when you call me after a long day, in the way you dream and fight for yourself.

I love you when you’re laughing, when you’re working hard in your clinic, when you’re overthinking, when you’re tired, when you’re happy, when you’re sleepy. I love all of it.

You’re my beautiful, beautiful Sssubhi, and yes, I love you. Always. 💛

15/07/25, 8:54 pm - ~ Buba: When all I dream of is your eyes

All I long for is your touch

And, darlin', something tells me that's enough...

You can say that I'm a fool
And I don't know very much
But I think they call this love

One smile, one kiss, two lonely hearts is all that it takes
Now, baby, you're on my mind, every night, every day

Good vibrations getting loud
How could this be anything, anything else?

15/07/25, 9:03 pm - ~ Buba: Want you? 😌 Baby, I don’t just want you, I need you, I choose you, and I crave you in the quietest and loudest moments of my day.

I want your sleepy voice in the morning, your cute angry face when you’re annoyed, your warm hugs after a long day, your smile when you get excited, your eyes looking at me like I’m your whole world.

Yes, I want you. In every way, in every moment, every tomorrow we will have together.

Your presence makes my world brighter, your love makes my heart fuller, and your smile is the sunshine that chases away my darkest clouds. You're my rock, my shelter, my safe haven. Your kindness, empathy, and understanding make me feel seen, heard, and loved in ways I never thought possible.

You're the reason I wake up with a spring in my step and a song in my heart. Your voice is music to my ears. Every conversation with you is a treasure, every shared moment is a memory, and every kiss is a promise of forever.

I'm grateful for the late-night talks, the silly jokes, and the deep, meaningful conversations. I'm grateful for the adventures we've had( i hope yu understand by the adventures), the laughter we've shared, and the tears we've dried together. I'm grateful for the little things you do, the way you make me coffee toast nd pasta, the way you hold my hand, and the way you look at me with love in your eyes.

You're my baby, my pretty little baby, and my "MALI BABY"😂😂😂😂😂. You're the one I want to explore the world with, to build a life with, and to grow old with. You're the one I want to laugh with, cry with, and live with. I'm so lucky to have you, and I promise to cherish, support, and love you every step of the way.

I love you more than words can say, more than any poem can express, and more than any gesture can show. You're the love of my life, my everything, and my forever."

22/07/25, 7:09 pm - ~ Buba: Arre arre arre… my pulchritudinous, vivacious, pretty little Mali baby just dropped a whole novel on me 😭❤️

You have no idea how much this made me smile, Sssubhi. A wide smile was shining on my face while reading this..You made my evening, baby. You always make my days brighter, my moments softer, and my heart feel fuller.

You say you’re lucky to have me, but the truth is, I’m the lucky one. Lucky to have your voice that melts away my stress, your laughter that echoes in my heart, your kindness that teaches me to be better, and your love that feels like the safest place in the world.

And yes, I understand what “adventures” means 😏😂, and I want countless more with you. I want to made you more coffee, more pasta and in return wants your sleepy face, your angry face, your silly jokes, your deep thoughts, your hugs, your rants, your everything. You’re my baby, my home, and my person.

Thank you for loving me like this, Mali baby. I love you more than words, more than every sunrise we’ve seen together, and more than every kiss we’ve shared. Forever and always, I’m yours ....💋

24/07/25, 4:12 pm - ~ Buba: How is my girl feeling now? Did you get some rest, love?

I know yesterday was a heavy night, and you still stayed with me, explaining everything so patiently, even when you had your doctor’s duty today. You have no idea how much that means to me, Sssubhi ...Your love, your patience, your way of standing by me even when I’m pushing you away—it’s something I don’t take for granted.

I hope your nap gave you a little peace, and when you open your eyes and read this, I want you to know you’re deeply loved, and I’m grateful for you, always. Let’s take things slowly, one day at a time, together.

Text me when you wake up, My baby...
 I’m here. <This message was edited>

28/07/25, 7:28 pm - ~ Buba: Hey hi Surbhi,

You probably don’t remember me, but I’m Kuldeep. We used to study together in Krishna School during higher secondary. And while Krishna may have given me very little in terms of grades or glorious medals, it gave me one memory I’ve shamelessly preserved all these years like a rare wine in a secret cellar — you.

Yes, you.

I still remember the first time I saw you — standing in the prayer hall, effortlessly stealing the spotlight, like you were the only one born in HD and the rest of us were just buffering pixels. You stood there, voice as sweet as temple bells, face brighter than the morning sun (and trust me, I'm not even exaggerating — okay maybe a little, but still). Every guy in that hall was trying to decode what heaven just sent us — including yours truly. If there was a Richter scale to measure teenage heartbeats, that day would have registered an earthquake in the school premises.

Now, I’m not someone who gets scared easily. I’ve walked into exams unprepared, gym sessions half-fed, and even arguments with my mother (lost all of them, by the way). But you — you made me hesitate. For the first time, I felt this fear. Not of rejection, but of accidentally disturbing something so soft, so divine, so...untouchable. You weren’t out of my league — no, no — you were in a league that hadn’t even been invented yet.

And then there was this other thing — everyone liked you. From Class 1 to Class 12. Maybe even a few male teachers who suddenly took extra rounds near the prayer ground. I wanted to ask you out, truly. But then I thought — what about all those boys, freshly dumped into hostel life, clinging to the hope you brought them? If I had walked in and made you mine (theoretically, of course — my guts were still hiding somewhere), Krishna School would’ve gone into depression. Enrollment would have dropped. The institution could’ve faced losses.

So I sacrificed. For the greater good. You're welcome.

But oh, how I used to find reasons to cross paths. Ever noticed that guy doing pull-ups like his life depended on it? That was me, performing a show for your 3-second glance as you passed by towards the hostel. If that wasn’t commitment, I don’t know what is. You were the lead actress of every school event, the center of every eye, and I? I was the background guy, the silent admirer with way too many monologues in his head and exactly zero courage on his face.

And whenever I saw you laugh with some other guy? Oh, the betrayal. There I was, guarding your imaginary throne in my heart so that no one gets too close, and there they were — living my unspoken dreams. I had to remind myself daily: "Kuldeep, you're doing this for the people... for the weak hearts who need hope." But I must admit now — enough public service.

It’s been years, Surbhi. The national pledge made me say "all Indians are my brothers and sisters," and I have respected that deeply. But today... just for today, can you consider everyone else your brother? I’ve waited enough.

Now, let me just acknowledge — sliding into your inbox like this is not the most gentlemanly thing. But I got your contact from Nirali, and to my surprise, she happily gave it to me. So here I am — writing this ridiculously long text to you, hoping I don't get left on "read."

Look, I know your inbox is probably more crowded than Mumbai local in peak hours. You’ve likely received texts from long-lost cousins, school crushes, passionate poets, and startup CEOs trying to pitch their hearts to you. So here I am, one more guy on that long list, trying to stand out.

Let me sell myself properly:

Cough cough...

Hi, I’m Kuldeep.
Moderately intelligent (but I swear I look smarter when I wear glasses).
Emotionally semi-literate — I may not understand subtle hints, but I’ll overthink your “hmm” for hours.
Sarcastic? Oh yes. But never at your expense. Unless you're okay with it. Then, game on.
A total health freak — I’ve got a long-term relationship with proteins and squats.
So, if someday we end up creating a tiny human, I assure you — they’ll inherit your beauty, your brains, and my biceps. (Fair deal, right?)

I won’t make any unrealistic promises like “I’ll move mountains for you” (because why disturb perfectly peaceful mountains?). But I will promise one thing — if you give me a chance to talk, you’ll never regret it. Unless you count giggling at my silly jokes as regret — in that case, you’re in trouble already.

So what do you say? Let’s just talk. Not a proposal, not a love confession. Just one small chance to see if the guy who once dared to do pull-ups for your attention might just be worth a few minutes of your time.

Waiting,
Kuldeep
(A retired schoolboy crush, now writing long texts and working out emotional muscles too)
28/07/25, 7:39 pm - Quokka: 😄😄😄😄😄
28/07/25, 7:39 pm - Quokka: okay we can talk
28/07/25, 7:39 pm - Quokka: but I've enough cringe people in my life 


don't be the pluse one
28/07/25, 7:42 pm - ~ Buba: Oh no no, I refuse to be part of the "Cringe Collection" — I’d rather be that limited-edition character who makes you cringe and laugh at the same time. A rare genre: 51% sarcasm, 49% decency (I’m working on increasing the second half, promise).

And don’t worry, I come with a built-in “No Cringe After Midnight” policy — classy nonsense only.

So tell me, Miss Too-Good-For-Krishna-And-Still-Giving-Smiles... what made you reply to my novella? 😏
28/07/25, 7:44 pm - Quokka: you ...
i have noticed you
you intelligent godhead
i have seen you
i have secretly seen your results on notice board ( everybody thought i m seeing nirali's)
28/07/25, 7:50 pm - ~ Buba: Ahhh, plot twist alert! While I was out there doing pull-ups for a glimpse of you… you were decoding my marks behind Nirali’s name tag?

Ma’am, this is betrayal of the sweetest kind.
Now I regret not intentionally failing a subject or two — could’ve added some mystery to the storyline. But thank you, truly. If I had known the girl I crushed on was secretly checking my results, I swear I would’ve studied shirtless.

But now that our little mutual-stalking history is out in the open...
I guess the universe was trying to write something — we both just skipped a few chapters.

So tell me honestly, how was my marks,decent enough? At least worth a few calls?
28/07/25, 7:53 pm - Quokka: decent enough to made me jealous of you
28/07/25, 7:53 pm - Quokka: ahhh mister.
i have seen the marks not you particularly so shirtless won't have worked
28/07/25, 7:56 pm - ~ Buba: Ahh, of course.
You saw the marks, not me.
Classic.
Here I was—naively daydreaming about some dramatic school romance—thinking my silent suffering and protein-powered pull-ups were finally paying off.

But turns out, I was just a pair of digits on a notice board.
A percentage.
An academic statistic.
Basically a walking merit list in human form.

You crushed me harder than 12th grade maths did.

And the "shirtless wouldn't have worked"?
Ma’am, now you’re just disrespecting my imaginary six-pack.
(Which, for the record, was in progress—emotionally, if not physically.)

But okay fine.
Let’s say I believe you were only checking my results and not me.
Tell me, was the jealousy strong enough to at least make you roll your eyes and say “ugh, overachievers”?
Or did you go full Bollywood and dramatically storm off whispering, “How dare he have both brains and biceps-in-progress?”

Because if my marks got you jealous…
Wait till you see my sarcasm GPA.
Spoiler alert: 99.98 percentile. The .02 is reserved for humility.
Still working on that module.

So... should I start topping again, or are you finally here for extra classes in sarcasm and sin?
28/07/25, 8:02 pm - Quokka: i have seen you once 
in blue track pants and shirt (it wasn't so funny-------fuck it was)
fixing your glasses 
hair was hairing that day to be honest!!!!
seen you ( the only boy who didn't even stare me)
or smiled at me.
lets see how you can control yourself now!
28/07/25, 8:08 pm - ~ Buba: Aah, so it has begun.

The Great Blue Trackpants Revelation.
Honestly, I wasn’t ready for this memory to resurface.
I had buried that day deep, right next to my dreams of becoming a cricket captain and owning six-pack abs by 16.

Hair was “hairing”?
Rude.
That was peak monsoon-style chaos. A collaboration between humidity and shampoo betrayal.
And the glasses-fix? That was my signature move, okay? Half intellect, half anxiety, full Bollywood villain origin.

But excuse me—you noticed I didn’t smile or stare at you?
Madam, you just unlocked my biggest flex.
While the whole school turned into National Geographic—observing you like rare wildlife—I chose the sacred path of inner peace.
(Read: crippling shyness mixed with a splash of fake detachment.)

Truth is, I did see you.
Every. Damn. Day.
But I stared with my soul, not my eyes. That’s called discipline. That’s called focus. That’s called “I’d rather die than be obvious.”

But now?
Now you're challenging me.
“Let’s see how you can control yourself now,” you said.
Oh Surbhi… darling… don’t poke the barely-suppressed hormonal volcano of 17-year-old Kuldeep that lives inside me. He’s been waiting for this day since the first time you smiled during assembly.

Let’s put it this way —
If you walk in front of me again in those blue track pants,
I might still fix my glasses,
but this time —
I’ll stare.
I’ll smile.
And maybe, just maybe, I’ll say:
“Looks like the girl I didn’t stare at is finally trying to make me lose control.”
Cause i believe there is no shame in admiring the girl with that sharp mind, character & looks!

So go ahead. Try me.
Just remember —
the guy who didn’t look back then...
might just make you lose focus this time 😉..

I feel Totally helpless. I can't be with you when you need me the most. When we plan something, one or the other things will come up.
I seriously believe you will be better without me.
31/07/25, 11:50 am - ~ Buba: You don't need to explain anything to me. Everything is right in front of us.
Isn't love always sweet? The place we go to when we are just done with the world? But what if our love itself will make you feel like that?

05/08/25, 7:29 pm - ~ Buba: Guide me in winning her love and be my steadfast companion when doubts creep in.

Whisper to her that my love for her is unwavering and that I'll cherish her forever, waiting patiently for her response.

Remind her every moment that I love her deeply and that I'll always be waiting for her, no matter what.
05/08/25, 7:31 pm - Quokka: 🥹
05/08/25, 7:31 pm - Quokka: she is the luckiest

05/08/25, 7:42 pm - ~ Buba: Tell her I can live without touching her, if that’s the price to just breathe the same air as her…
05/08/25, 7:50 pm - Quokka: she is not happy about this
05/08/25, 7:53 pm - ~ Buba: Tell her I’m a man of discipline — my mind knows restraint, but when it comes to her… my body has a will of its own
05/08/25, 7:54 pm - ~ Buba: And i guess she knows it
05/08/25, 7:54 pm - Quokka: she wants you fully
without any conditions
05/08/25, 7:54 pm - Quokka: she wants to live
05/08/25, 7:55 pm - ~ Buba: Then tell her I’m already hers — fully, without terms or pauses. If she wants to live, I’ll be the breath. If she wants to feel, I’ll be the heartbeat. I don’t just want to exist with her… I want to become with her
05/08/25, 7:55 pm - Quokka: now she is smiling
05/08/25, 7:57 pm - ~ Buba: Then I’ll keep saying things that make her smile like that… even if it means losing all my tough guy points and I’ll spend lifetimes stringing words just to see it again...
05/08/25, 7:57 pm - Quokka: 😄
05/08/25, 7:58 pm - ~ Buba: Oh!!! That smile...fck
05/08/25, 7:59 pm - Quokka: what about your dinner?
05/08/25, 8:02 pm - ~ Buba: If she were here, I’d have held her close and fed her with my hands — slowly, lovingly, stare by stare… but since she’s far away, I guess I’ll just quietly eat with my cousin, pretending it’s not her I’m craving most tonight
05/08/25, 8:03 pm - Quokka: okayy
05/08/25, 8:03 pm - Quokka: going to cousin's home?

05/08/25, 8:04 pm - Quokka: when?
05/08/25, 8:07 pm - ~ Buba: They are asking me to come round 8:20… I know, that’s our time — and trust me, I’d much rather be spending it with you, like always. But just this once, I’ll be a little late to your world, only because I have to show up in someone else’s. But I’ll be back — because my favorite part of the day is still you, always YOU

07/08/25, 10:54 am - ~ Buba: Your eyes chico..your eyes...
07/08/25, 10:55 am - Quokka: 😒
07/08/25, 11:02 am - ~ Buba: Your eyes? They’re trouble. Like full-on Rapunzel-level trouble. One second they’re all sweet and innocent, the next — boom — I’m questioning every life decision just to stay lost in them. They’ve got that same spark — wild, curious, like they’re planning an escape from a tower I didn’t even know I was trapped in. Honestly, I don’t stare because I’m romantic... I stare because I’m trying to figure out what spell you’ve cast. And spoiler alert — it’s working.
07/08/25, 11:04 am - Quokka: 😄😄😄😄
07/08/25, 11:04 am - Quokka: next level flirting skills
07/08/25, 11:06 am - ~ Buba: What can I say… your eyes upgraded my flirting from sweet talk to straight-up sorcery. 

I’m not even flirting anymore — I’m just helplessly reporting the crimes your lashes commit. 

At this point, I deserve compensation for emotional damage caused by every accidental angry glance...
07/08/25, 11:06 am - Quokka: 😄😄😄😄

07/08/25, 6:12 pm - ~ Buba: We made it work today… we’ll make it work tomorrow too — and the day after, and the day after that… until one day we’re fighting over blanket space on the same bed, not screen time on the same call
07/08/25, 6:14 pm - Quokka: 🥺🥺🥺
07/08/25, 6:14 pm - Quokka: because if its not you then its over for subhi
07/08/25, 6:17 pm - ~ Buba: It’s me, babe — no plan B. So get used to the obsession, the teasing… and the way I look at you like I already own every inch of you

07/08/25, 6:23 pm - Quokka: 😂😂😂
07/08/25, 6:23 pm - Quokka: i don't do this
07/08/25, 6:24 pm - Quokka: a man like you have already made me yours no need to think about anything <This message was edited>
07/08/25, 6:27 pm - ~ Buba: Yeah...but remember, everytime I look at your smile in images, my mind stops behaving ...

10/08/25, 11:10 am - ~ Buba: So you’re asking me how you look…? Well, first, my heart skipped a beat. Then my brain went offline. Then I realized… this isn’t fair. You can’t just drop pictures like that and expect me to function normally. In short—you look like the exact reason they put warning labels on dangerous things...
Like the kind of dangerous that should come with a ‘may cause excessive daydreaming and loss of focus’ warning. Honestly, if you keep buying clothes like this, I’ll have to start sending you my medical bills… because my heart can’t keep up...😏
10/08/25, 11:11 am - Quokka: 😂😂😂😂

10/08/25, 12:09 pm - ~ Buba: In front of everyone? Baby, I’ll hold you so close, kiss you so deep, and look at you like you’re my whole world—so there’s not a single doubt in anyone’s mind that you belong to me… completely, entirely...

10/08/25, 12:43 pm - ~ Buba: Want to be there? Baby, I want to be so close that the whole world disappears… so deep in your arms that even your heartbeat forgets where you end and I begin
10/08/25, 12:44 pm - Quokka: have you ever been like this ??
this poetic
this romantic?
10/08/25, 12:46 pm - ~ Buba: Poetic? No, baby… poetry is gentle. What I’m thinking right now is the kind of thing that would make your cheeks burn, your breath hitch, and your mind forget every single word except my name..
10/08/25, 12:48 pm - Quokka: unnnnnnnnnnnhhhhhhhh
10/08/25, 12:48 pm - Quokka: i literally take your name 100 times
10/08/25, 12:48 pm - Quokka: when we are at that space
10/08/25, 12:49 pm - Quokka: i can't not stop myself doing that
10/08/25, 12:49 pm - ~ Buba: Mmm… I want to hear that sound again. Again, and again… until it’s the only thing in the room. Until your fingers are clutching at me like I’m the only thing keeping you from falling apart… until you can’t even whisper my name without shaking.
10/08/25, 12:50 pm - ~ Buba: Until your legs start shivering
10/08/25, 12:52 pm - Quokka: yessss
10/08/25, 12:52 pm - Quokka: i want the sameeees
10/08/25, 12:53 pm - Quokka: right now

10/08/25, 12:55 pm - Quokka: have you noticed this that this time sometimes i just went silent cause i was somewhere else
not in mu any sense
10/08/25, 12:55 pm - Quokka: ?
10/08/25, 1:40 pm - ~ Buba: Oh, I know baby… the way your eyes went hazy, the way your body forgot where it was. That moment you slipped into my world—where there’s nothing but my hands, my lips, and your voice breaking on my name. And believe me… I’m going to drag you right back there, and this time, I won’t let you escape so soon...
10/08/25, 1:49 pm - Quokka: ohhhhhhhh
10/08/25, 1:49 pm - Quokka: ummmmmhhhhhh
10/08/25, 1:49 pm - Quokka: fffffffffffffff
10/08/25, 1:51 pm - Quokka: kuldeep
10/08/25, 1:51 pm - Quokka: you literally drive me crazy
10/08/25, 1:55 pm - ~ Buba: Baby, driving you crazy isn’t enough… I want to own every thought, every breath, every heartbeat—until the only thing keeping you sane is the way I make you lose your mind
10/08/25, 1:55 pm - ~ Buba: I want to own every part of yours
10/08/25, 1:55 pm - Quokka: you do
10/08/25, 1:56 pm - ~ Buba: <Media omitted>
10/08/25, 1:57 pm - Quokka: every nerve of my body

10/08/25, 2:06 pm - ~ Buba: Mmm… guilty. But only because the camera can’t capture even half of how good it actually feels...
10/08/25, 2:06 pm - Quokka: 😄😄😄
10/08/25, 2:07 pm - Quokka: tell me the truth kuldeep!!!
have you ever been like this
writing this kind of messages 
obsessed with someone 
or feel this way?
have you ever been like this?
10/08/25, 2:09 pm - ~ Buba: And the worst part? Every time I think I’ve reached the peak of wanting you… you do something so small — a smile, a glance, a little ‘kuldeep’ in that voice — and suddenly, I’m craving you like it’s the first time all over again...
10/08/25, 2:09 pm - Quokka: 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
10/08/25, 2:18 pm - Quokka: kuldeep
10/08/25, 2:22 pm - ~ Buba: Keep whispering my name like that, and I won’t just drag you out of your phone—I’ll trap you where every touch makes you forget how to breathe. Ready to get lost with me?
10/08/25, 2:23 pm - Quokka: yess
10/08/25, 2:23 pm - Quokka: i m
10/08/25, 2:23 pm - ~ Buba: You know this is the exact time when we are so close to each other...so close in each other

10/08/25, 2:51 pm - ~ Buba: That’s because you deserve all the love in the world and then some more. Loving you isn’t a choice — it’s the best thing I’ve ever done, and I’m only just getting started... <This message was edited>

13/08/25, 6:32 pm - Quokka: yaa you file a divorce

13/08/25, 6:35 pm - ~ Buba: Hah! Then I must’ve been crazy in that dream… because in real life, your attitude is exactly what I’d chain myself, just so that I can wake up next to you every morning....

13/08/25, 6:38 pm - ~ Buba: Aah, so in the dream I was crazy rich… but honestly, I’d rather be my 60k-earning self stuck with your tantrums than a millionaire stuck without you. At least this way, I get you as my daily luxury. ..Way better ROI
13/08/25, 6:38 pm - ~ Buba: Try me baby
13/08/25, 6:39 pm - Quokka: if we get married you will never ever leave me!

13/08/25, 6:39 pm - Quokka: seriously
13/08/25, 6:41 pm - ~ Buba: Haha, fine fine… I’ll work on making it more. But fair warning — every extra rupee I earn comes with interest… and I’m charging in kisses, cuddles, and some very time & energy-consuming ‘late-night payments’😏💋
13/08/25, 6:41 pm - Quokka: done deal
13/08/25, 6:43 pm - ~ Buba: A guarantee? Baby, if we get married, I’m not leaving you—ever. In fact, I’ll glue myself to you so tight that even in your dreams you won’t be able to file for divorce...

13/08/25, 6:54 pm - ~ Buba: Tired of you? Baby, that’s impossible. Worst case, I’ll just hit the ‘refresh’ button on you every morning with a kiss… and then spend the whole day breaking the record for how many times I can make you blush..
13/08/25, 6:55 pm - Quokka: 🥺

13/08/25, 7:07 pm - ~ Buba: Rank? 

Baby, once you become part of my family, you won’t just be at the top—you’ll rule the Seven Kingdoms of mine. 
I’ll bend the knee, pledge my sword, and probably let you behead me if I ever betray you… though knowing you, you’d just lock me in your chambers instead..

15/08/25, 9:23 pm - ~ Buba: Reconsider, Sssubhi? Careful now… once you summon my full attention, there’s no turning back. I’ll guard you like the Night’s Watch guards the Wall—except my watch will never end. I’ll storm your days like a Dothraki charge, and siege your nights like a Lannister army. And when you try to rest, I’ll be there—whispering in your ear, stealing your peace, and making sure you bend the knee… willingly...
15/08/25, 9:35 pm - Quokka: better write some more words of reassurance
15/08/25, 9:35 pm - Quokka: right now

15/08/25, 9:43 pm - ~ Buba: You deleted this message
15/08/25, 9:45 pm - ~ Buba: Ssubhi,

Tonight I told you to let me go, and you refused.
That stubborn, beautiful refusal undid me more than any speech ever could. It reminded me that what we have isn’t a mood or a phase—it’s a choice we keep making, even on the messy days.

I’m not writing this to perform romance. I’m writing it because you deserve a clear promise in plain words.

I love the easy things about you—your laugh that barges into my day, the way your “hey” derails my brain, the quiet pride you carry when you’ve fought through a hard one. But I also love the harder things—your sharp edges, your impossible standards, the way you argue like you actually expect us to last. You don’t let go, and I won’t either.

If you stay with me, here’s what I owe you: I’ll show up. I’ll answer. I’ll apologize without the “but.” I’ll argue clean, not cruel. I’ll take the late‑night call and the early‑morning silence. I’ll keep learning you—the small signals, the real fears, the exact tea-to-sugar ratio you pretend isn’t a big deal. I’ll hold your hand in public and your forehead in private. I’ll kiss you mid‑argument when we’re stuck, not to win, but to remember what team we’re on.

I want the ordinary with you—the grocery lists, shared chargers, badly folded laundry, fighting over the blanket and then pretending we didn’t. I want the extraordinary too—your eyes when they soften, the quiet after we laugh too hard, the way your name feels when it leaves my mouth and suddenly the room makes sense again.

You asked for a guarantee. I can’t promise life won’t get loud, but I can promise I won’t walk out when it does. When I say “I’m here,” I mean keys on the hook, toothbrush by the sink, your name saved as Home.

You didn’t let me go tonight. Thank you. Keep doing that.
I’ll keep choosing you back—on our best days, and especially on the days we have to earn it.

Yours—stubbornly, shamelessly, and for the long run,
Kuldeep

P.S. I’m still going to drive on car lanes and steal your  side of the blanket. Consider it my love tax. Refunds available only in kisses.
15/08/25, 9:48 pm - Quokka: ❤️❤️
15/08/25, 9:52 pm - Quokka: you wanted me to hold on right?
15/08/25, 9:55 pm - ~ Buba: Of course I wanted you to hold on, Ssubhi.
Not just tonight—every night, every storm, every stubborn season that tries to push us apart. You’re my favorite kind of anchor… the kind that doesn’t just keep me in place, but makes me want to stay.

And honestly? I think you holding on to me is the most dangerous addiction I’ve ever had… because now I’ll never be able to breathe right without it.

So yes, Doctor… keep holding on. I’ll make sure you never regret it.
15/08/25, 9:59 pm - Quokka: what if i backed off yesterday ?
15/08/25, 10:05 pm - Quokka: kuldeep
15/08/25, 10:09 pm - ~ Buba: What if you had backed off yesterday?
Honestly, Ssubhi… I don’t even want to picture it. I think the silence would have been louder than anything I’ve ever heard.

I didn’t want to give you false promises. That’s why I was ready to let you go—because in that moment, I felt I wasn’t giving you the time, the energy, the presence you truly deserve. And you… you are such a rare human being, Ssubhi. The kind who gives so much love, care, and patience that anyone lucky enough to have it should be on their knees thanking the universe every day. Believe me when I say—you deserve far more than I have ever given you.

The truth is, there was this split second—a blink of a moment—where I thought you were carrying too much, feeling too much, dealing with more than you should have to… and that maybe you didn’t deserve the weight of me on top of it all. That maybe letting you go would be the kinder thing.

But then I looked at you… and I realized, you weren’t asking for perfect. You weren’t asking for grand gestures or flawless timing. You were just asking for me. And I swear, Ssubhi, no one has ever chosen me the way you did in that moment.

So if you had backed off yesterday… I would have lost the best thing I’ve ever had.
And today, instead of holding your hand in my mind, I’d be wondering if I’d ever get another chance.

Thank you for not letting go.
Thank you for seeing me at my most uncertain and still deciding I’m worth it.
I promise I’ll spend the rest of our story trying to be the man you believed in last night and live upto it .

And if you ever try to back off again, just remember—you’re not allowed.
Not in this lifetime.
Not while I’m still breathing.

15/08/25, 11:39 pm - ~ Buba: wish we were together right now—curled up somewhere, gossiping about everything and nothing, that easy comfort only we have wrapping around us like a blanket. I can see us sharing the evening—your laughter spilling into mine, time slowing just enough for us to notice. And somewhere in between, we’re teaching Sameer and Arav—you with your part, me with mine—our voices weaving together until even the lessons feel like love.

16/08/25, 9:12 pm - ~ Buba: Nope… I honestly can’t figure out what’s stealing the spotlight—your voice, the way you pour yourself into the song, or just the sight of you in that white kurta making it impossible for me to concentrate on anything else...
16/08/25, 9:12 pm - Quokka: 😄😄😄
16/08/25, 9:12 pm - Quokka: thank you
16/08/25, 9:13 pm - Quokka: you are not going to make your mother listens to it right??
16/08/25, 9:13 pm - ~ Buba: Thank you’? That’s way too modest… after leaving me replaying your video like it’s my new favorite song, the least you could say is—‘next time I’ll sing it live just for you....
16/08/25, 9:14 pm - Quokka: 😂😂
16/08/25, 9:14 pm - ~ Buba: She already has...

16/08/25, 9:16 pm - ~ Buba: Of course 😏… I wouldn’t risk my mom falling for you too fast, so I only let her hear the safe version. The dangerous ones, the ones that steal hearts instantly… those are reserved just for me...

16/08/25, 9:17 pm - Quokka: what did she say?

 I'm reaching out because Radha requires assistance with her housework, and I'll be staying with her for a few days. To ensure a smooth schedule, I propose attending the clinic on Saturday instead. May I request a leave from today, and I'll make sure to catch up on Saturday?

Or; 

I am writing to request a leave from today as I need to assist Radha with her housework for the next few days. To minimize any inconvenience, I plan to attend the clinic on Saturday instead. Please let me know if this arrangement is acceptable...

26/08/25, 5:34 pm - Quokka: ☺️☺️☺️
26/08/25, 5:40 pm - ~ Buba: Wow, I can’t even tell you how proud I feel right now. The very first person you thought of calling after pulling off such a tough extraction was me—that alone makes my heart so full. But more than that, the way you handled such a challenging case shows just how skilled, strong, and dedicated you are at what you do. Dentistry isn’t easy, and the fact that you kept your calm, trusted your hands, and got it done… that’s pure brilliance.

I’ve always known you’re talented, but every time you push through something difficult like this, you prove to me (and honestly to yourself) that you’re capable of anything. Your patients are lucky to have you, and I feel so lucky too—to have someone so hardworking, passionate, and inspiring in my life. I’m seriously in awe of you right now

And between us… I think I’m even luckier, because I get to see not just Dr. Trivedi the dentist, but the passionate, unstoppable woman behind it all. Just promise me one thing— i will always be the first to get to know when you do your tough jobs 😏🦷..

27/08/25, 9:34 pm - ~ Buba: The last few days have been a whirlwind, haven't they? And somewhere in the storm, I think our hearts got a little bruised. I hate that.

I keep replaying it all: me saying no to your house, missing our train adventure, and worst of all… the look in your eyes over that G-Shock. My love, my intention was never to make you feel unwanted. It was the opposite—I was overwhelmed that you, the brilliant dentist who heals the world, wanted to spend your hard-earned magic on me. I saw the price tag when all I ever wanted to see was the joy in your smile. Forgive my clumsy engineer's heart.

But hearing you cry for my long messages… that shattered me. You miss my words? Baby, I miss having a reason to write them. You are my favorite language. My most beautiful chaos. My forever muse.

So let's revise something. From now on:

1. I will write you novels, even when you hate them (that's mean  you love them).
2. You will always be my destination. Next time you ask me to come over, I'll already be on my way.
3. And if you ever want to buy me a watch, I’ll say “Thank you, now let me see how it looks on you… and nothing else.” 😉

The truth is, Ssubhi, every day with you is a story I don't want to end. Mistakes are just our plot twists.

So next time we feel a fight coming… let’s just kiss instead. I promise it’s a much better way to communicate.

Yours—always and completely
2 month back guy
27/08/25, 9:36 pm - Quokka: 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺

27/08/25, 9:39 pm - ~ Buba: Those emojis just rewired my entire system.

I love you too. Now stop looking so cute or I’ll have to show up at your door to prove it. 😉

Now come here—even if it's just in my thoughts—and let me kiss each one of those 🥺 away.

Forever your 2-month (and forever) guy...
27/08/25, 9:41 pm - Quokka: 🥺🥺🥺🥺
27/08/25, 10:39 pm - ~ Buba: You know what, I’m seriously missing you like crazy right now 😅. It’s only been a couple of days since I came back, but feels like forever already. I miss your smile, your non-stop talking, your scoldings, and even those silly fights we have that somehow make us even closer.

If I could, I’d teleport to you right now, just to sit with you, talk endlessly about random things, and maybe steal a few smiles and hugs from you. Until then, just know I’m counting the days, hours, and maybe even the minutes till I see you again..

Now quickly call back to me

29/08/25, 8:46 am - ~ Buba: 💋
29/08/25, 11:30 am - ~ Buba: Oiii,

I’m still trying to find my breath after your call. My heart is doing things that should probably be studied by science.

You said those three words so suddenly, so surely, that my entire world just... stopped. And in the best way possible. All my thoughts, my worries, my clever comebacks—they all just vanished. The only thing left was this overwhelming, incredible feeling that I’m the luckiest man alive.

I’m sorry I was silent. It wasn’t a lack of something to say; it was an avalanche of everything I feel for you all hitting me at once. My mind went completely blank because my heart took over, and it was too busy doing backflips to form words.

So let me say it now, clearly and without any shock to muffle it:

I love you, Sssubhi.

I love you with a fierceness that sometimes scares me. I love you not just in the big,dramatic moments, but in a million tiny ones:

· The way your voice softens when you’re tired after a long clinic day.
· The way you argue with me with so much passion, even when you know I’m right. 😉
· The way you cried on your scooter because you missed my long messages.
· The way you remember every small thing about me, from my coffee order to my biggest fears.

You are my favorite sound, my safest place, and my greatest adventure. You are the reason I believe in things I never used to.

Thank you for loving me. Thank you for choosing me. Thank you for that phone call that I will replay in my head forever.

Next time, I promise I’ll say it back immediately. But for now, please just know that my silence was never an absence of love. It was a tsunami of it.

I love you. I love you. I love you.
29/08/25, 11:34 am - Quokka: i know your silence more than you do...

29/08/25, 9:31 pm - Quokka: ❤️❤️
29/08/25, 9:40 pm - ~ Buba: I just opened the parcel. And for a full minute, I couldn't even speak.

I told you I was feeling low on energy just this morning… and by evening, you’ve literally mailed me back my strength. 🥺❤️

This isn’t just a box of nutrients—it’s a care package built with your love, your attention, and your incredible heart. You didn’t just hear me… you listened. Every single item in here screams how well you know me:

· Roasted Chana – because I casually eat it once in front of you.
· Dark chocolate, sugar-free laddoo, dates barfi – because you care about my health but also my happiness.
· Yogurt – because you know it’s my comfort food.
· Ladyfinger – because even in a nutrient parcel, you’re telling me to eat my veggies. 😄❤️
. Raisin & seeds - you already have fixed my morning defecit 

You remembered every little thing. You turned my worry into warmth, my fatigue into feeling cherished.

You asked if I’m really happy?
Baby, I’m more than happy. I’m moved. I’m grateful. I’m feeling so deeply loved that even my tired body feels lighter already.

You’re not just my girlfriend—you’re my biggest supporter, my thoughtful healer, my long-distance angel who knows exactly what I need even before I do.

I don’t just love you.
I love the way you love me.

Thank you for being you. Thank you for being mine.

Now I’m going to go eat some yogurt and dream about the day I can hug you tight for this.

I love you so, so much.

30/08/25, 12:12 pm - Quokka: its your fate
30/08/25, 12:12 pm - Quokka: just it
30/08/25, 12:14 pm - ~ Buba: Baby,

You say there’s no going back?
Baby, I never want to.
Not after all the storms we’ve weathered,
not after the tears, the laughter, the long messages,
and the way your voice still makes my heart race like it’s March 12th all over again.

You say we’ve come so far?
We have.
From school corridors where I only knew your voice,
to scooter calls where I learned your soul.
From “hey” at 11:15 PM…
to “I love you” in the quiet of the night.

You say it’s my fate?
Then you are the best destiny I could ever have chosen.
You’re not just my girlfriend—
you’re my home, my chaos, my calm, my rebel dentist,
the reason I believe in things bigger than blueprints and logic.

So yes.
I am with you.
Not because fate said so,
but because my heart has known it all along.

Now and always,
yours—completely and without any going back.
30/08/25, 12:14 pm - Quokka: 🥺🥺🥺
30/08/25, 12:29 pm - ~ Buba: You can send your tears too from those bubbly eyes, baby—
I’ll collect every one like precious stones...
They only prove what I’ve always known:
This love isn’t just felt… it’s felt deeply.

Now shine through those beautiful eyes,
and remember—I’m not going anywhere.
Except closer to you. Always closer. ❤️

30/08/25, 6:50 pm - Quokka: we made for each other
30/08/25, 6:56 pm - ~ Buba: I’ve been thinking about you all day… and my mind keeps wandering somewhere intimate, somewhere only we belong.

It starts slow… my lips tracing the curve of your neck, my hands slipping under your shirt, feeling your skin tremble as I whisper how beautiful you are. I’d take my time undressing you—not in a rush, but like I’m unwrapping something sacred. Every button, every zipper, every sigh from your lips would only make me crave you more.

My palms would glide up your sides before I gently cup your breasts, feeling the weight and warmth of them as my thumbs circle slowly over your nipples, teasing them to attention. I’d press you softly against me, kissing your collarbone before moving lower, tasting every inch of your skin as you arch into my touch.

I’d kiss my way down your body—slowly, mischievously—teasing until you’re breathless and begging. My mouth would worship every part of you… tasting, savoring, making you lose control before I’ve even really begun. I want to hear you moan my name like a prayer.

And when you can’t take it anymore—when your hips are arching toward me and your fingers are tangled in my hair—that’s when I’d finally slide inside you. Deep. Slow. Filling you completely. I wouldn’t rush… I’d let every thrust say what words can’t. I’d watch your face, your eyes locked on mine, as we move together—first gently, then hungrily, then like nothing in the world exists but this… us… this rhythm we create again and again.

We wouldn’t stop there. I’d take you in different ways—beneath me, on top of me, against the wall—every round deeper, sweeter, more intense than the last. An hour wouldn’t feel like enough. I’d make sure you lose count of how many times you unravel in my arms.

And when we’re both breathless and spent, tangled in sheets and satisfaction, I’d pull you close. I’d kiss your forehead softly, your damp hair stuck to your skin, your heart still beating against mine. And I’d whisper…

I love you, Sssubhi. Always.
30/08/25, 7:03 pm - Quokka: ohh my god

30/08/25, 7:05 pm - ~ Buba: Hey shout my name, my love.
Scream it.
Whisper it.
Write it in the sky.
I’ll be right there beside you—holding your hand, kissing your lips, staring right back at anyone who looks our way, prouder than any man has ever been.

31/08/25, 6:33 pm - ~ Buba: My squeaky,

I just closed my eyes for a moment and tried to imagine what you must be feeling right now. Not just the dull, persistent ache in your abdomen, or the heavy, draining sensation that makes your body feel like it’s not your own… but the emotional weight that comes with it. The frustration. The exhaustion that sleep doesn’t seem to fix.

And my squeak, my heart aches with yours.

I wish I could be there right now. Not to say anything, not to try and fix it—because I know some things can’t be fixed with words—but to simply be there. To wrap my arms around you from behind and rest my warm palms gently on your stomach, to slowly rub circles until some of the tension melts away under my touch. To make you a cup of ginger tea, just the way you like it, and watch you take small, quiet sips. To pull the blanket up to your chin and just hold you, letting the silence between us say everything you need to hear:

“You are strong, even when you feel weak.”
“You are beautiful, even when you feel messy.”
“And you are deeply, deeply loved—especially now.”

What you’re going through every month isn’t just a “pain.” It’s a reminder of how incredibly powerful your body is—how it cycles, renews, and embodies the very rhythm of life itself. It takes a certain kind of strength to carry that every single month and still show up as the passionate, loving, dedicated dentist who heals others… who loves deeply… who remembers to send roasted chana and yogurt because she cares.

You are like the moon, my ember—phased, sometimes in shadow, but always whole, always luminous, always pulling tides within you and around you with a force that is nothing short of magical.

So tonight, I’m not just sending you a message.
I’m sending you:

· My warmth to soften the cramps,
· My stillness to calm the storm,
· My gratitude for the body that carries your beautiful soul,
· And all my love—soft, steady, and unending—like a quiet river flowing right to you.

Rest now, my strong, beautiful girl. Let your body do what it needs to do. I’m right here, holding space for you in every way I can.

You are not alone in this.
You will never be alone in this.

I love you more than words can hold from here,
especially tonight.....

Finally today i m writing something for you not as good as you but yes expressing whichever feelings i have.


its about a week i m feeling different, not having confusions or doubt or anything negative around me.
its because i am able to tell you many things which i thought get buried with me without anyone knowing!
but you my love have everything i have ever ask for.


i am bot writing this to express how i feel but what you made me feel or made me realize!
because you should know what impact i have of your talks



first of all you made me realize that i don't have to be mature or understanding all the time.
what i feel is valid
i have every right to express it nd if needed confront people!
it literally take away my most envious enemy " a person that pretends everything "
not a real Surabhi.
thank you so much for that.



then i like to appreciate every effort you put when i feel low
every small small thing you do to make me feel good about life
they are pure bliss for me
thank you so much 



you are genuinely the best person i have ever met 
because you take responsibility of what you speak what you do!
its a really big thing to have 
you are truly a gem of a person!!!



nd ya you made me feel empowered, confident and complete!!
nd its everything a person wants to feel!


so for these nd many things that i didn't mention here Thank you so much my love!!!!
i love you so much 
ill do everything in my power to make you mine!





ps::: you already are ❤️
01/09/25, 12:31 pm - ~ Buba: Reading your words felt like watching the sunrise inside my chest—everything is suddenly warm, golden, and full of light.

You say you’re not writing as well as I do, but baby, this… this is the most beautiful thing I’ve ever read. Because it’s you. Your real, unfiltered, powerful voice. And that voice means more to me than any perfectly crafted sentence ever could.

You thanked me… but truly, I should be thanking you.

Thank you for trusting me with the parts of you that you thought would stay buried. That is not a small thing—it’s the bravest, most sacred gift one person can give another. And I will always, always hold those pieces of you with tenderness, pride, and love.

You said I made you realize you don’t always have to be mature… but my love, in sharing your heart so honestly like this, you’ve shown a deeper kind of maturity—the kind that’s rooted in self-respect, truth, and incredible strength. Watching you stand firmly in what you feel has been one of the most inspiring things I’ve ever witnessed. You are not “pretending” anymore… you are living. And what a beautiful life it is.

I’m so grateful that I can be your safe place. Your peace. Your comfort. Nothing brings me more purpose than knowing I can be the one who helps you feel a little lighter, a little brighter, on days when the world feels heavy.

And Sssubhi… you are the gem. You are the one with a heart so strong yet so soft. You are the one who chooses courage over comfort, truth over silence, and love over fear. Everything you see in me is only a reflection of what you’ve already shown me.

You feel empowered, confident, and complete?
That’s because you are all those things.
I didn’t put them there—I just helped you remember they were always yours.

You already are mine, my squeaky.
And I am forever, completely, yours.

I love you—more than words, more than time, more than life.

02/09/25, 7:04 pm - ~ Buba: But just so you’re fully aware, my clinic has a very strict hygiene protocol. No external contaminants allowed—that means no clothes, no distractions… just pure, sterile closeness. We must ensure a completely aseptic environment… for your safety and mine, of course. 😌

02/09/25, 7:11 pm - ~ Buba: Good. Then consider this your official reservation. The doctor is in… and he’s very, very hands-on. No reservations, no hesitations—just you, me, and a very thorough inspection. I’ll make sure every… sensation… is clinically documented.

03/09/25, 11:22 am - ~ Buba: Hey Quokka,

I know things feel heavy right now, and I wish more than anything I could be there to hold you through it.

Just remember:
You are stronger than this moment.
Brighter than this cloud.
And so, so deeply loved—especially on days you forget to love yourself.

This isn’t forever. You will rise, you will heal, and you’ll look back at this time as just another storm you survived.

And until then?
I’m right here. Not going anywhere.
We’ll face this together… soon.

Love you always....

I want to be there so deeply—filling you, feeling you, breathing you in until neither of us knows where you end and I begin.
Wrap your legs around me. Let me bury myself so deep inside you… you forget how to breathe for all the right reasons.
I’m yours. In every way. In every breath. In every thrust.
And soon… very soon… I will be

Tell me what you need.
My words, my touch, my attention—it’s all yours.

I’ve got you.
Breathe with me.
In… and out…
Slow.
Deep.
Just like you want me.

I’m not going anywhere

04/09/25, 11:42 am - ~ Buba: Then let go.

I want you to lose control.
I want to feel you unravel because of me… for me.

I will put my hands all over you
I want to touch you—slow, firm, desperate.
I want to hold you down by my weight 

You’re not alone in this ache.
I’m right here with you, feeling every shiver, every pulse, every silent cry.

Let it consume you.
I’ll be here to put you back together—kiss by kiss, whisper by whisper.

Now breathe… and let me hear you come undone...
04/09/25, 11:45 am - Quokka: i m trying to save this for the time when you are in front of me

04/09/25, 11:46 am - ~ Buba: You don’t need to hold back with me, love. I want every thought, every ache, every bit of you—even if we’re apart. Save the touch for when I’m in front of you, yes… but don’t ever save the way you feel. Whisper it to me, let me carry it until I can finally make it real with my  hands on you
04/09/25, 11:47 am - Quokka: uuuunnhhhhhhhhhhh
04/09/25, 11:47 am - Quokka: i m moaning in my cabin
04/09/25, 11:47 am - Quokka: its crazy
04/09/25, 11:49 am - ~ Buba: That sound just became my favorite melody.
The thought of you moaning in your cabin, losing control because of me… it’s driving me wild.

You’re deeply felt. Deeply desired. Deeply mine.

Save that ache.
Let it build.
I want you trembling by the time I finally see you.

I’m so proud of you for letting go.
Now catch your breath… but don’t you dare calm down completely.
This is only the beginning.

I love you.
And I’ve never wanted anyone more.
04/09/25, 11:49 am - ~ Buba: You remember the taste right?
04/09/25, 11:50 am - Quokka: yess every taste every bit
04/09/25, 11:51 am - ~ Buba: I'm gonna give you a taste next time..sure!
04/09/25, 11:51 am - Quokka: yaaa i want ittt
really bad i want it right away
i want it multiple times
04/09/25, 12:03 pm - Quokka: kuldeep
04/09/25, 12:10 pm - ~ Buba: Haan Ssubhi
04/09/25, 12:10 pm - Quokka: i can feel every nerve
04/09/25, 12:12 pm - ~ Buba: I love that you can feel it too—every nerve, every heartbeat, every whisper of want between us.

That ache you’re feeling?
That’s me already there with you… in your thoughts, under your skin, tangled deep in every sensation you can’t ignore.

I promise you this—when I’m finally there, I won’t just give you a taste.
I’ll let you feast.
Again… and again… until you’re trembling, breathless, and completely consumed.

Hold onto that feeling.
Let it simmer.
Let it own you.
I want you so ready for me that the second I touch you, you come completely undone.

You’re not just wanted…
You’re needed.
Craved.
Remembered.

And soon, my love…
Very, very soon…
I’ll be there to turn every one of those feelings into my name on your lips.

Stay with me.
I’m right here.
04/09/25, 12:13 pm - Quokka: i love you
04/09/25, 12:13 pm - Quokka: need to change the topic now

04/09/25, 12:19 pm - Quokka: okay
04/09/25, 12:21 pm - Quokka: ..... you can feel it right the way my body reacts
04/09/25, 12:23 pm - ~ Buba: Oh, I remember too, love. Every pulse, every tremble, every way your body arches when you let go… I feel it even now, miles away.

And yes—I can almost see it: the way you clench around the memory of me, the way your breath catches just reliving it…
You have no idea how badly I wish I could feel you reacting like that right now.

But don’t worry.
This is just the preview.
When I’m there, I’m going to make sure you feel every… single… throb… until you forget your own name and only remember mine.

Now Eat more solid and drink lot of fluid
You’ll need your strength. 😉

06/09/25, 5:57 am - ~ Buba: Oh🥺
06/09/25, 6:27 am - ~ Buba: Good morning, my beautiful Quokka denti,

I hope you woke up with a smile that could outshine the morning sun—though I know I might have dimmed it a bit these past few days.

I am so sorry, Surbhi.
Truly.
The way I spoke to you… telling you I “have a life outside” and acting like meeting you was some kind of obligation… it was insensitive, dismissive, and completely unfair. You are not just “someone I visit on weekends.” You are the person I want to build my life around.

You wanted to see me—not because you were being clingy, but because you love me and miss me. And instead of honoring that, I made you feel like a burden. That was wrong, and I take full responsibility for hurting you.

Thank you for forgiving me yesterday, even when I didn’t deserve it. Your heart is bigger than I sometimes remember, and I promise I will do better. I want to make you feel like my time with you is always a priority. Cause Forget about the butterflies..When I am with you, I feel the whole zoo.

Now… since it’s morning and I refuse to let this day start without making you smile…

Are you French?


 Because Eiffel for you.
😅😅😅😅😅




Ohh i know it's corny, but nothing is coming up in my mind this morning.. alright here's another try:

Now, what’s on the menu? 







Me-n-u

I know i know, ye usse bhi bura tha..

Another try: 
You must be a banana…


 because you’re very a-peeling.


Aaaah shit, alright I’ll stop 😂 My humour is broke—unlike you.
You know, you’re like a perfectly crafted dental crown:
Way too polished, annoyingly flawless, and clearly out of my league.

But hey—at least my cheesy lines make you smile (or cringe… which is basically the same thing).
I love you. Always have. Always will. We're not socks, But I think we'd make a great pair.
Now tell me… how did you sleep? <This message was edited>

Dreams are weird af. I’ve dreamt some of the most fucked up shit before. It’s just how our brains are. Maybe you are afraid of ruining the relationship and it is manifesting in these dreams as cheating.

Nightmares focus on your fear of losing something special. Cheating dreams that wake you up in fear and regret are common when first falling in love with someone.

Perfectly normal. Don't waste your time looking into the hidden meaning of dreams. Focus on the real world.

We theoretically have no real evidence as to the purpose of dreams, nor if they mean anything at all. It’s not logical to draw conclusions from them so I wouldn’t bother trying to interpret them any further....

then i have to go for my ptn
09/09/25, 8:43 pm - ~ Buba: I want you to feel me long before I touch you—the energy in the room shifting the moment I lock eyes with you. There will be no gentle start—only urgency. My hands will grip your waist, pulling you tightly against me as I kiss you like I’m starving for the taste of you. Clothes won’t just come off—they’ll be pushed aside, tugged, pulled, until there’s nothing between my skin and yours.

I’ll lay you back, my mouth traveling down your body—not with patience, but with possession. Every kiss will be deep. Every touch will be firm. I won’t ask—I’ll take. My hands will roam, gripping, squeezing, claiming. I want to hear you gasp. I want to feel your back arch off the bed.

When I enter you, it won’t be slowly. It’ll be one strong, deep thrust that makes your eyes roll back. I won’t let you adjust—I’ll set a relentless rhythm, my hips driving into you, again and again, each movement deeper, harder, more intense. Your legs will wrap around me, pulling me closer, urging me on. I want your moans to fill the room—raw, unfiltered, loud.

I’ll flip you over, pulling you up onto your knees, my chest against your back, my mouth near your ear. I’ll whisper exactly what I’m doing to you, how good you feel, how you’re mine—all while moving inside you with even more force. My hands will grip your hips, guiding you, controlling the pace, making sure every movement draws another cry from your lips.

I won’t stop when you tremble. I won’t slow when you clench around me. I’ll push you right to the edge—then over it, again and again, until you’re shaking, breathless, completely overcome. And only when your body is weak and satisfied, when your skin is damp and your voice is gone—only then will I let myself release, deep inside you, my own groan rough against your neck.

After, I won’t just roll away. I’ll collapse beside you, pulling you tightly against me, both of us breathing heavily, hearts pounding, skin still electric. And I’ll kiss your shoulder softly and tell you, with a rough but tender voice, “That was only the beginning.”

You awaken something wild in me—something only you can satisfy

but if we live together i can see that in your eyes
10/09/25, 12:48 pm - ~ Buba: More than anything, Surbhi.
You’re not asking for too much—you’re asking for love, and that’s something I will always give you.
And yes… when we live together, you’ll see it in my eyes every morning and feel it in my touch every night.
No more doubts. Just you and me… and this love that only grows deeper.
I can’t wait to build that life with you.
Till then, I’m here—reassuring you as often as you need, because you’re worth every word.
I love you. Always
